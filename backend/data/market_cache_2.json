Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, at settlement, one share of common stock.  \n2. This transaction represents the settlement of restricted stock units in shares of common stock on their scheduled vesting date.  \n3. These shares are held through Mr. Cook's trust.  \n4. Shares withheld by Apple to satisfy tax withholding requirements on vesting of restricted stock units.  \n5. This transaction was made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the reporting person on May 24, 2024.  \n6. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $254.21 to $255.20; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n7. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $255.21 to $256.20; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n8. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $256.21 to $257.20; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n9. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $257.21 to $258.14; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n10. This award was granted on September 25, 2022, for a target number of 199,429 restricted stock units. The award settled on October 1, 2025, applying a percentage of the target number of restricted stock units that was determined based on Apple's total shareholder return (\"TSR\") relative to the other companies in the S&P 500 from the first day of Apple's fiscal year 2023 and ending with the last day of Apple's fiscal year 2025.  \n11. TSR is calculated based on the change in a company's stock price during the performance period, taking into account any dividends paid during that period, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. In accordance with the terms of the award, the beginning value used for calculating TSR is the average closing stock price for the first 20 trading days of the performance period. Apple's beginning value was calculated to be $143.67. Similarly, the ending value used for calculating TSR is the average closing price for the final 20 trading days of the performance period. Apple's ending value was calculated to be $244.54.  \n12. This award provided that if Apple's relative TSR performance was ranked at or above the 85th percentile for companies in the S&P 500 for the performance period, 200% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was ranked at or above the 55th percentile, 100% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was ranked at or above the 25th percentile, 25% of the target number of restricted stock units vest, and if Apple's performance was ranked below the 25th percentile, 0% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was between these levels, the portion of the restricted stock units that vest would be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages.  \n13. Apple's TSR for the three-year performance period was 70.22%, which ranked 162 of the 483 companies that were included in the S&P 500 for the performance period and placed Apple in the 66.60th percentile. Therefore, 277,206 restricted stock units subject to performance requirements vested.  \n**Remarks:**  \n| _/s/ Sam Whittington, Attorney-in-Fact for Timothy D.

Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, at settlement, one share of common stock.  \n2. This transaction represents the settlement of restricted stock units in shares of common stock on their scheduled vesting date.  \n3. Shares withheld by Apple to satisfy tax withholding requirements on vesting of restricted stock units.  \n4. This transaction was made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the reporting person on August 27, 2024.  \n5. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $256.985 to $257.98; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n6. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $257.99 to $258.145; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n7. This award was granted on September 25, 2022, for a target number of 66,477 restricted stock units. The award vested on October 1, 2025, applying a percentage of the target number of restricted stock units that was determined based on Apple's total shareholder return (\"TSR\") relative to the other companies in the S&P 500 from the first day of Apple's fiscal year 2023 and ending with the last day of Apple's fiscal year 2025.  \n8. TSR is calculated based on the change in a company's stock price during the performance period, taking into account any dividends paid during that period, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. In accordance with the terms of the award, the beginning value used for calculating TSR is the average closing stock price for the first 20 trading days of the performance period. Apple's beginning value was calculated to be $143.67. Similarly, the ending value used for calculating TSR is the average closing price for the final 20 trading days of the performance period. Apple's ending value was calculated to be $244.54.  \n9. This award provided that if Apple's relative TSR performance was ranked at or above the 85th percentile for companies in the S&P 500 for the performance period, 200% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was ranked at or above the 55th percentile, 100% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was ranked at or above the 25th percentile, 25% of the target number of restricted stock units vest, and if Apple's performance was ranked below the 25th percentile, 0% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was between these levels, the portion of the restricted stock units that vest would be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages.  \n10. Apple's TSR for the three-year performance period was 70.22%, which ranked 162 of the 483 companies that were included in the S&P 500 for the performance period and placed Apple in the 66.60th percentile. Therefore, 92,403 restricted stock units subject to performance requirements vested.  \n**Remarks:**  \n| _/s/ Sam Whittington, Attorney-in-Fact for Deirdre O'Brien_ | _10/03/2025_  \n---|---|---  \n| ** Signature of Reporting Person | Date  \nReminder: Report on a separate line for each class of securities beneficially owned directly or indirectly.  \n* If the form is filed by more than one reporting person, _see_ Instruction 4 (b)(v).  \n** Intentional misstatements or omissions of facts constitute Federal Criminal Violations _See_ 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C. 78ff(a).  \nNote: File three copies of this Form, one of which must be manually signed.

The Trust is an \u201cExchange-Traded Fund\u201d, the units of which are listed on and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) under the symbol \u201cSPY\u201d, and operates under an exemptive order granted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to purchase a security representing a proportionate undivided interest in a portfolio of securities consisting of substantially all of the component common stocks, in substantially the same weighting, which comprise the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500\u00ae Index (the \u201cS&P 500\u00ae Index\u201d). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in the Trust is referred to as a \u201cUnit\u201d. The Trust commenced operations on January 22, 1993 upon the initial issuance of 150,000 Units (equivalent to three \u201cCreation Units\u201d - see Note 5) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.\nUnder the Amended and Restated Standard Terms and Conditions of the Trust, as amended (the \u201cTrust Agreement\u201d), PDR Services, LLC (the \u201cSponsor\u201d) and State Street Global Advisors Trust Company (the \u201cTrustee\u201d) are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters into contracts that contain general indemnification clauses. The Trust\u2019s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Trustee expects the risk of material loss to be remote.\nThe Sponsor is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (\u201cICE\u201d). ICE is a publicly-traded entity, trading on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cICE.\u201d\nNote 2 \nThe Trust has one reportable segment. Business activities are managed on a consolidated basis and revenues are derived primarily through the Trust's investments in accordance with its investment objective. The Trust's chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) is the President of the Trustee. The CODM assesses performance based on the Trust's Total Return as reported in the Financial Highlights, and the same accounting policies are applied as described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Trust's Total Return is utilized by the CODM to compare results, including the impact of the Trust's costs, to the Trust's competitors and to the Trust's benchmark index.\nNote 3 \nThe following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trustee (who is responsible for the preparation of the Trust's financial statements) in the preparation of the Trust's financial statements:\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) requires the Trustee to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trust is an investment company under U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting guidance applicable to investment companies.\n15\n* * *\n[ Table of Contents ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/884394/000119312525130577/d931023dn30d.htm#job_spdr__5ad9ef80-3a5a-4bf8-bcfd-8b68dda18cfe_toc-notebook)\nSPDR S&P 500\u00ae ETF Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued) \nMarch 31, 2025 (Unaudited)\n* * *\nNote 3 \u2013\nSecurity Valuation\nThe Trust\u2019s investments are valued at fair value each day that the NYSE is open and, for financial reporting purposes, as of the report date should the reporting period end on a day that the NYSE is not open. Fair value is generally defined as the price a fund would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. By its nature, a fair value price is a good faith estimate of the valuation in a current sale and may not reflect an actual market price. The investments of the Trust are valued pursuant to the policy and procedures developed by the Oversight Committee of the Trustee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d). The Committee provides oversight of the valuation of investments for the Trust. \nValuation techniques used to value the Trust\u2019s equity investments are as follows:\nEquity investments (including preferred stocks) traded on a recognized securities exchange for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last sale price or official closing price, as applicable, on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Equity investments traded on a recognized exchange for which there were no sales on that day are valued at the last published sale price or at fair value.\nIn the event that prices or quotations are not readily available or that the application of these valuation methods results in a price for an investment that is deemed to be not representative of the fair value of such investment, fair value will be determined in good faith by the Committee, in accordance with the valuation policy and procedures approved by the Trustee.\nFair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Trust\u2019s net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) and the prices used by the Trust\u2019s underlying index, the S&P 500\u00ae Index, which in turn could result in a difference between the Trust\u2019s performance and the performance of the S&P 500\u00ae Index.\nThe Trustee values the Trust's assets and liabilities at fair value using a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to readily available unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements) when market prices are not readily available or reliable. The categorization of a value determined for an investment within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the investment and is not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with the investment.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n\u2022 Level 1 \u2013 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\u2022 Level 2 \u2013 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as exchange rates, financing terms, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and\n16\n* * *\n[ Table of Contents ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/884394/000119312525130577/d931023dn30d.htm#job_spdr__5ad9ef80-3a5a-4bf8-bcfd-8b68dda18cfe_toc-notebook)\nSPDR S&P 500\u00ae ETF Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued) \nMarch 31, 2025 (Unaudited)\n* * *\nNote 3 \u2013\ndefault rates) or other market-corroborated inputs; and\n\u2022 Level 3 \u2013 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including the Committee\u2019s assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments.\nInvestment Transactions and Income Recognition\nInvestment transactions are accounted for on the trade date for financial reporting purposes. Dividend income and capital gain distributions, if any, are recognized on the ex-dividend date, or when the information becomes available, net of any foreign taxes withheld at source, if any. Non-cash dividends received in the form of stock, if any, are recorded as dividend income at fair value. Distributions received by the Trust may include a return of capital that is estimated by the Trustee. Such amounts are recorded as a reduction of the cost of investments or reclassified to capital gains. The Trust invests in real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d). REITs determine the characterization of their income annually and may characterize a portion of their distributions as a return of capital or capital gain. The Trustee\u2019s policy is to record all REIT distributions as dividend income initially and re-designate a portion to return of capital or capital gain distributions at year end based on information provided by the REIT and/or Trustee\u2019s estimates of such re-designations for which actual information has not yet been reported. Realized gains and losses from the sale or disposition of investments are determined using the identified cost method.\nDistributions\nThe Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income, if any, to its holders of Units (\u201cUnitholders\u201d), quarterly. Capital gain distributions, if any, are generally declared and paid annually. Additional distributions may be paid by the Trust to avoid imposition of federal income and excise tax on any remaining undistributed net investment income and capital gains. The amount and character of income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with federal tax regulations which may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for U.S. GAAP purposes.\nEqualization\nThe Trustee follows the accounting practice known as \u201cEqualization\u201d by which a portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the Trust's Units, equivalent on a per Unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed net investment income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per Unit is unaffected by sales or reacquisitions of the Trust's Units. Amounts related to Equalization can be found on the Statements of Changes in Net Assets.\nFederal Income Taxes\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Trust has qualified as a \u201cregulated investment company\u201d under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (a \u201cRIC\u201d), and intends to continue to qualify as a RIC. As a RIC, the Trust will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax for any taxable year on income, including net capital gains, that it distributes to its Unitholders, provided that it distributes on\n17\n* * *\n[ Table of Contents ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/884394/000119312525130577/d931023dn30d.htm#job_spdr__5ad9ef80-3a5a-4bf8-bcfd-8b68dda18cfe_toc-notebook)\nSPDR S&P 500\u00ae ETF Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued) \nMarch 31, 2025 (Unaudited)\n* * *\nNote 3 \u2013\na timely basis at least 90% of its \u201cinvestment company taxable income\u201d determined prior to the deduction for dividends paid by the Trust (generally, its taxable income other than net capital gain) for such taxable year. In addition, provided that the Trust distributes substantially all of its ordinary income and capital gains during each calendar year, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal excise tax. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles, which may differ from U.S. GAAP.\nU.S. GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Trust\u2019s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the Trust recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position is more likely than not to be sustained, assuming examination by tax authorities.\nThe Trustee has reviewed the Trust's tax positions for the open tax years as of September 30, 2024 and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Trust\u2019s financial statements. Generally, the Trust\u2019s tax returns for the prior three fiscal years remain subject to examinations by the Trust\u2019s major tax jurisdictions, which include the United States of America, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New York. The Trustee has the Trust recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to tax liabilities as income tax expense in the Statements of Operations. There were no such expenses for the year ended September 30, 2024.\nNo income tax returns are currently under examination. The Trustee has analyzed the relevant tax laws and regulations and their application to the Trust\u2019s facts and circumstances and does not believe there are any uncertain tax positions that require recognition of any tax liabilities. Any potential tax liability is also subject to ongoing interpretation of laws by taxing authorities. The tax treatment of the Trust\u2019s investments may change over time based on factors including, but not limited to, new tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.\nDuring the six months ended March 31, 2025, the Trustee reclassified $57,942,813,304 of non-taxable security gains realized from the in-kind redemption of Creation Units (Note 5) as an increase to paid in capital in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\nAt March 31, 2025, gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation of investments based on cost for federal income tax purposes were as follows:\n| Tax   \nCost  |  | Gross   \nUnrealized  \nAppreciation  |  | Gross   \nUnrealized  \nDepreciation  |  | Net Unrealized  \nAppreciation  \n(Depreciation)   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSPDR S&P 500\u00ae ETF Trust\n* * *\n| $631,668,690,690  |  | $14,454,358,260  |  | $76,824,030,982  |  | $(62,369,672,722)   \n18\n* * *\n[ Table of Contents ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/884394/000119312525130577/d931023dn30d.htm#job_spdr__5ad9ef80-3a5a-4bf8-bcfd-8b68dda18cfe_toc-notebook)\nSPDR S&P 500\u00ae ETF Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued) \nMarch 31, 2025 (Unaudited)\n* * *\nNote 4 \nState Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cSSBT\u201d), the parent of the Trustee, maintains the Trust\u2019s accounting records, acts as custodian and transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including the filing of certain regulatory reports. The Trustee pays SSBT for such services. The Trustee oversees the services provided by SSBT and is responsible for determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust\u2019s portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or weighting structure of the S&P 500\u00ae Index. For these services, the Trustee received a fee at the following annual rates for the six months ended March 31, 2025:\nNet asset value of the Trust  |  | Fee as a percentage of net asset value of the Trust   \n---|---|---  \n$0 \u2013 $499,999,999  \n$500,000,000 \u2013 $2,499,999,999  \n$2,500,000,000 and above  |  | 0.10% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount  \n0.08% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount  \n0.06% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount   \nThe adjustment amount (the \u201cAdjustment Amount\u201d) is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders for the creation and redemption of Units and (b) the amounts earned by the Trustee with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust. During the six months ended March 31, 2025, the Adjustment Amount reduced the Trustee\u2019s fee by $35,485,652. The Adjustment Amount included an excess of net transaction fees from processing orders of $3,536,790 and a Trustee earnings credit of $31,948,862.\nThe Trustee has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of its fee, as needed, for one year until February 1, 2026, so that the total operating expenses would not exceed 0.0945% per annum of the daily NAV of the Trust. No amounts were waived for the six months ended March 31, 2025 and the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Trustee has not entered into an agreement with the Trust to recapture waived fees in subsequent periods, and the Trustee may discontinue the voluntary waiver.\nIn accordance with the Trust Agreement and under the terms of an exemptive order issued by the SEC, dated December 30, 1997, the Sponsor is reimbursed by the Trust for certain expenses up to a maximum of 0.20% of the Trust\u2019s NAV on an annualized basis. The expenses reimbursed to the Sponsor for the six months ended March 31, 2025 and the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, did not exceed 0.20% per annum. The licensing and marketing fee disclosed below are subject to both the reimbursement from the Trust to the Sponsor and expense limitation of 0.20% of the Trust\u2019s NAV for the six months ended March 31, 2025 and the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Trust reimbursed the Sponsor for $72,457, $384,319, $446,722 and $300,191 of legal fees for the six months ended March 31, 2025, and the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are included in Legal and audit fees on the Statements of Operations.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (\u201cS&P\u201d), per a license from Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services LLC, and State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC (\u201cSSGA FD\u201d or the \u201cMarketing Agent\u201d) have entered into a license agreement (the \u201cLicense Agreement\u201d).

The S&P 500\u00ae Index also serves as the basis for determining the composition of the Trust\u2019s portfolio. The Trustee (on behalf of the Trust), the Sponsor and NYSE Arca, Inc. (\u201cNYSE Arca\u201d, the principal U.S. listing exchange for the Trust) have each received a sublicense from SSGA FD for the use of the S&P 500\u00ae Index and certain trade names and trademarks in connection with their rights and duties with respect to the Trust. The License Agreement may be amended without the consent of any of the owners of beneficial interests of Units. Currently, the License Agreement is scheduled to terminate on November 29, 2031, but its term may be extended without the consent of any of the owners of beneficial interests of Units. Pursuant to such arrangements and in accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust reimburses the Sponsor for payment of fees under the License Agreement to S&P equal to 0.03% of the daily size of the Trust (based on Unit closing price and outstanding Units) plus an annual license fee of $600,000.\nThe Sponsor has entered into an agreement with the Marketing Agent pursuant to which the Marketing Agent has agreed to market and promote the Trust. The Marketing Agent is reimbursed by the Sponsor for the expenses it incurs for providing such services out of amounts that the Trust reimburses the Sponsor. Expenses incurred by the Marketing Agent include, but are not limited to: printing and distribution of marketing materials describing the Trust, associated legal, consulting, advertising and marketing costs and other out-of-pocket expenses.\nALPS Distributors, Inc. (the \u201cDistributor\u201d) serves as the distributor of the Units. The Sponsor pays the Distributor for its services a flat annual fee of $25,000, and the Trust does not reimburse the Sponsor for this fee.\nInvestments in Affiliates of the Trustee and the Sponsor\nThe Trust has invested in companies that are considered affiliates of the Trustee (State Street Corp.) and the Sponsor (ICE). Such investments were made according to the representative portion of the S&P 500\u00ae Index. The market values of these investments at March 31, 2025 are listed in the Schedule of Investments.  \n\nNote 5 \nUnits are issued and redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000 Units. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a separate cash payment that is equivalent to the undistributed net investment income per Unit (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to equate the transaction to the NAV per Unit of the Trust on the transaction date. There is a transaction fee payable to the Trustee in connection with each creation and redemption of Creation Units made through the clearing process (the \u201cTransaction Fee\u201d). The Transaction Fee is non-refundable, regardless of the NAV of the Trust. The Transaction Fee is the lesser of $3,000 or 0.10% (10 basis points) of the value of one Creation Unit at the time of creation per participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units created or redeemed on such day. The Transaction Fee is currently $3,000.

Net realized gain (loss) on investment transactions in the Statement of Operations includes net gains resulting from in-kind transactions of $57,942,813,304.  \n\nNote 7 \nAn investment in the Trust involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund of equity securities, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates, perceived trends in securities prices, war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Trust and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Trust\u2019s net asset value. For example, conflict, loss of life and disaster connected to ongoing armed conflicts between Ukraine and Russia in Europe and Israel and Hamas in the Middle East could have severe adverse effects on their respective regions, including significant adverse effects on the regional or global economies and the markets for certain securities. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in sanctions against Russian governmental institutions, Russian entities, and Russian individuals that may result in the devaluation of Russian currency; a downgrade in the country\u2019s credit rating; a freeze of Russian foreign assets; and a decline in the value and liquidity of Russian securities, properties, or interests. These Russian-related sanctions as well as the potential for military escalation and other corresponding events in Europe and the Middle East, and the resulting disruption of the Russian and Israeli economies, may cause volatility in other regional and global markets and may negatively impact the performance of various sectors and industries, as well as companies in other countries, which could have a negative effect on the performance of the Trust, even if the Trust does not have direct exposure to securities of Russian or Israeli issuers.\nAn investment in the Trust is subject to the risks of any investment in a broadly based portfolio of equity securities, including the risk that the general level of stock prices may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of such investment. The value of common stocks actually held by the Trust and that make up the Trust's portfolio (the \"Portfolio Securities\") may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of Portfolio Securities, the value of equity securities generally and other factors. The identity and weighting of common stocks that are included in the S&P 500\u00ae Index and the Portfolio Securities change from time to time.\nThe financial condition of issuers of Portfolio Securities may become impaired or the general condition of the stock market may deteriorate, either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the Trust's portfolio and thus in the value of Units. Since the Trust is not actively managed, the adverse financial condition of an\n21\n* * *\n[ Table of Contents ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/884394/000119312525130577/d931023dn30d.htm#job_spdr__5ad9ef80-3a5a-4bf8-bcfd-8b68dda18cfe_toc-notebook)\nSPDR S&P 500\u00ae ETF Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued) \nMarch 31, 2025 (Unaudited)\n* * *\nNote 7 \u2013\nissuer will not result in its elimination from the Trust\u2019s portfolio unless such issuer is removed from the S&P 500\u00ae Index. Equity securities are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises, as well as war, acts of terrorism and the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues.\nThe impact of infectious disease outbreaks that may arise in the future, could adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. Public health crises may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries or globally. These factors, as well as any restrictive measures instituted in order to prevent or control a pandemic or other public health crisis could have a material and adverse effect on the Trust\u2019s investments.\nHolders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations of the issuer because the rights of common stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally are subordinate to the rights of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer. Further, unlike debt securities that typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity, or preferred stocks that typically have a liquidation preference and may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Equity securities values are subject to market fluctuations as long as the equity securities remain outstanding. The value of the Trust's portfolio will fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust.\nThere can be no assurance that the issuers of Portfolio Securities will pay dividends. Distributions generally depend upon the declaration of dividends by the issuers of Portfolio Securities and the declaration of such dividends generally depends upon various factors, including the financial condition of the issuers and general economic conditions.  \n\nNote 8 \nThe Trustee has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Trust through the date on which the financial statements were issued and has determined that there were no subsequent events requiring adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n22\n* * *\n[ Table of Contents ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/884394/000119312525130577/d931023dn30d.htm#job_spdr__5ad9ef80-3a5a-4bf8-bcfd-8b68dda18cfe_toc-notebook)\nSPDR S&P 500\u00ae ETF Trust\nOther Information\nMarch 31, 2025 (Unaudited)\n* * *\nComparison of Total Returns Based on NAV and Bid/Ask Price(1)\nThe table below is provided to compare the Trust\u2019s total pre-tax return at NAV with the total pre-tax returns based on bid/ask price and the performance of the S&P 500\u00ae Index.

\nreferences to \u201cCall Observation Dates.\u201d\nAny payments on the Notes depend on the credit risk of BofA Finance, as Issuer, and BAC, as Guarantor, and on the performance of the Underlyings. The economic terms of the Notes are based on BAC\u2019s internal funding rate, which is the rate it would pay to borrow funds through the issuance of market-linked notes, and the economic terms of certain related hedging arrangements BAC\u2019s affiliates enter into. BAC\u2019s internal funding rate is typically lower than the rate it would pay when it issues conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities. This difference in funding rate, as well as the underwriting discount, if any, and the hedging related charges described below (see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page PS-11), will reduce the economic terms of the Notes to you and the initial estimated value of the Notes. Due to these factors, the public offering price you pay to purchase the Notes will be greater than the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the pricing date.\nThe initial estimated value range of the Notes is set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. The final pricing supplement will set forth the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the pricing date. For more information about the initial estimated value and the structuring of the Notes, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page PS-11 and \u201cStructuring the Notes\u201d on page PS-25.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME AUTO-CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-7 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Auto-Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Nikkei 225\u00ae Index and the Russell 2000\u00ae Index   \n---  \nContingent Coupon Payment and Redemption Amount Determination\n**On each Contingent Payment Date, if the Notes have not been previously called, you may receive a**\n**Contingent Coupon Payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes determined as follows:**\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_006.jpg)\n**Assuming the Notes have not been automatically called,****on the Maturity Date, you will receive a cash payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes determined as follows:**\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_007.jpg)\nAll payments described above are subject to the credit risk of BofA Finance, as Issuer, and BAC, as Guarantor.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME AUTO-CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-8 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Auto-Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Nikkei 225\u00ae Index and the Russell 2000\u00ae Index   \n---  \nTotal Contingent Coupon Payment Examples\nThe table below illustrates the hypothetical total Contingent Coupon Payments per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes over the term of the Notes, based on the Contingent Coupon Payment of $9.584, depending on how many Contingent Coupon Payments are payable prior to an Automatic Call or maturity.

Your decision to purchase the Notes should be made only after carefully considering the risks of an investment in the Notes, including those discussed below, with your advisors in light of your particular circumstances. The Notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about significant elements of the Notes or financial matters in general. You should carefully review the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections beginning on page PS-5 of the accompanying product supplement, page S-6 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and page 7 of the accompanying prospectus, each as identified on page PS-__29_ _below._\n**_Structure-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **Your investment may result in a loss; there is no guaranteed return of principal.** There is no fixed principal repayment amount on the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not automatically called prior to maturity and the Ending Value of **any** Underlying is less than its Threshold Value, at maturity, your investment will be subject to 1:1 downside exposure to decreases in the value of the Least Performing Underlying and you will lose 1% of the principal amount for each 1% that the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Starting Value. In that case, you will lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Your return on the Notes is limited to the return represented by the Contingent Coupon Payments, if any, over the term of the Notes.** Your return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupon Payments paid over the term of the Notes, regardless of the extent to which the Observation Value or Ending Value of any Underlying exceeds its Coupon Barrier or Starting Value, as applicable. Similarly, the amount payable at maturity or upon an Automatic Call will never exceed the sum of the principal amount and the applicable Contingent Coupon Payment, regardless of the extent to which the Observation Value or Ending Value of any Underlying exceeds its Starting Value. In contrast, a direct investment in the securities included in one or more of the Underlyings would allow you to receive the benefit of any appreciation in their values. Any return on the Notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned those securities and received the dividends paid or distributions made on them.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The Notes are subject to a potential Automatic Call, which would limit your ability to receive the Contingent Coupon Payments over the full term of the Notes.** The Notes are subject to a potential Automatic Call. Beginning with the January 20, 2026 Call Observation Date, the Notes will be automatically called if, on any Call Observation Date, the Observation Value of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Call Value. If the Notes are automatically called prior to the Maturity Date, you will be entitled to receive the Early Redemption Amount on the applicable Call Payment Date, and no further amounts will be payable on the Notes. In this case, you will lose the opportunity to continue to receive Contingent Coupon Payments after the date of the Automatic Call. If the Notes are called prior to the Maturity Date, you may be unable to invest in other securities with a similar level of risk that could provide a return that is similar to the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **You may not receive any Contingent Coupon Payments.** The Notes do not provide for any regular fixed coupon payments. Investors in the Notes will not necessarily receive any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes. If the Observation Value of any Underlying is less than its Coupon Barrier on an Observation Date, you will not receive the Contingent Coupon Payment applicable to that Observation Date. If the Observation Value of any Underlying is less than its Coupon Barrier on all the Observation Dates during the term of the Notes, you will not receive any Contingent Coupon Payments during the term of the Notes, and will not receive a positive return on the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Your return on the Notes may be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.** Any return that you receive on the Notes may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased a conventional debt security with the same Maturity Date. As a result, your investment in the Notes may not reflect the full opportunity cost to you when you consider factors, such as inflation, that affect the time value of money. In addition, if interest rates increase during the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon Payment (if any) may be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The Contingent Coupon Payment, Early Redemption Amount or Redemption Amount, as applicable, will not reflect changes in the levels of the Underlyings other than on the Observation Dates or Call Observation Dates, as applicable.** The levels of the Underlyings during the term of the Notes other than on the Observation Dates or Call Observation Dates, as applicable, will not affect payments on the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, investors should generally be aware of the performance of the Underlyings while holding the Notes, as the performance of the Underlyings may influence the market value of the Notes. The calculation agent will determine whether each Contingent Coupon Payment is payable and will calculate the Early Redemption Amount or the Redemption Amount, as applicable, by comparing only the Starting Value, the Coupon Barrier, the Call Value or the Threshold Value, as applicable, to the Observation Value or the Ending Value for each Underlying. No other levels of the Underlyings will be taken into account. As a result, if the Notes are not automatically called prior to maturity and the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Threshold Value, you will receive less than the principal amount at maturity even if the level of each Underlying was always above its Threshold Value prior to the Valuation Date.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Because the Notes are linked to the least performing (and not the average performance) of the Underlyings, you may not receive any return on the Notes and may lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes even if the Observation Value or Ending Value of one Underlying is greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier or Threshold Value, as applicable.** Your Notes are linked to the least performing of the Underlyings, and a change in the level of one Underlying may not correlate with changes in the levels of the other Underlyings. The Notes are not linked to a basket composed of the Underlyings, where the depreciation in the level  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME AUTO-CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-11 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Auto-Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Nikkei 225\u00ae Index and the Russell 2000\u00ae Index   \n---  \n|  of one Underlying could be offset to some extent by the appreciation in the levels of the other Underlyings. In the case of the Notes, the individual performance of each Underlying would not be combined, and the depreciation in the level of one Underlying would not be offset by any appreciation in the levels of the other Underlyings. Even if the Observation Value of an Underlying is at or above its Coupon Barrier on an Observation Date, you will not receive the Contingent Coupon Payment with respect to that Observation Date if the Observation Value of another Underlying is below its Coupon Barrier on that day. In addition, even if the Ending Value of an Underlying is at or above its Threshold Value, you will lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes if the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is below its Threshold Value.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Any payments on the Notes are subject to our credit risk and the credit risk of the Guarantor, and any actual or perceived changes in our or the Guarantor\u2019s creditworthiness are expected to affect the value of the Notes.** The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. Any payment on the Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor. The Notes are not guaranteed by any entity other than the Guarantor. As a result, your receipt of any payments on the Notes will be dependent upon our ability and the ability of the Guarantor to repay our respective obligations under the Notes on the applicable payment date, regardless of the performance of the Underlyings. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition or the financial condition of the Guarantor will be at any time after the pricing date of the Notes. If we and the Guarantor become unable to meet our respective financial obligations as they become due, you may not receive the amount(s) payable under the terms of the Notes.   \n  \nIn addition, our credit ratings and the credit ratings of the Guarantor are assessments by ratings agencies of our respective abilities to pay our obligations. Consequently, our or the Guarantor\u2019s perceived creditworthiness and actual or anticipated decreases in our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit ratings or increases in the spread between the yield on our respective securities and the yield on U.S. Treasury securities (the \u201ccredit spread\u201d) prior to the Maturity Date may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. However, because your return on the Notes depends upon factors in addition to our ability and the ability of the Guarantor to pay our respective obligations, such as the values of the Underlyings, an improvement in our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit ratings will not reduce the other investment risks related to the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **We are a finance subsidiary and, as such, have no independent assets, operations, or revenues.** We are a finance subsidiary of the Guarantor, have no operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of our debt securities that are guaranteed by the Guarantor, and are dependent upon the Guarantor and/or its other subsidiaries to meet our obligations under the Notes in the ordinary course. Therefore, our ability to make payments on the Notes may be limited.  \n---|---  \n**_Valuation and Market-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **The public offering price you pay for the Notes will exceed their initial estimated value.** The range of initial estimated values of the Notes that is provided on the cover page of this preliminary pricing supplement, and the initial estimated value as of the pricing date that will be provided in the final pricing supplement, are each estimates only, determined as of a particular point in time by reference to our and our affiliates\u2019 pricing models. These pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables, including our credit spreads and those of the Guarantor, the Guarantor\u2019s internal funding rate, mid-market terms on hedging transactions, expectations on interest rates, dividends and volatility, price-sensitivity analysis, and the expected term of the Notes. These pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity, their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and lower than their initial estimated value. This is due to, among other things, changes in the levels of the Underlyings, changes in the Guarantor\u2019s internal funding rate, and the inclusion in the public offering price of the underwriting discount, if any, and the hedging related charges, all as further described in \u201cStructuring the Notes\u201d below. These factors, together with various credit, market and economic factors over the term of the Notes, are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The initial estimated value does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which we, BAC, BofAS or any of our other affiliates would be willing to purchase your Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time.** The value of your Notes at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy, including the performance of the Underlyings, our and BAC\u2019s creditworthiness and changes in market conditions.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **We cannot assure you that a trading market for your Notes will ever develop or be maintained.** We will not list the Notes on any securities exchange. We cannot predict how the Notes will trade in any secondary market or whether that market will be liquid or illiquid.  \n---|---  \n**_Conflict-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **Trading and hedging activities by us, the Guarantor and any of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may create conflicts of interest with you and may affect your return on the Notes and their market value.** We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may buy or sell the securities held by or included in the Underlyings, or futures or options contracts or exchange traded instruments on the Underlyings or those securities, or other instruments whose value is derived from the Underlyings or those securities . While we, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may from time to time own securities represented by the Underlyings, except to the extent that BAC\u2019s common stock may be included in the Underlyings, we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, do not control any company included in the Underlyings, and have not verified any disclosure made by any other company. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may execute such purchases or sales for our own or their own accounts, for business reasons, or in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes. These  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME AUTO-CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-12 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Auto-Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Nikkei 225\u00ae Index and the Russell 2000\u00ae Index   \n---  \n|  transactions may present a conflict of interest between your interest in the Notes and the interests we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, may have in our or their proprietary accounts, in facilitating transactions, including block trades, for our or their other customers, and in accounts under our or their management. These transactions may adversely affect the levels of the Underlyings in a manner that could be adverse to your investment in the Notes. On or before the pricing date, any purchases or sales by us, the Guarantor or our other affiliates, including BofAS or others on our or their behalf (including those for the purpose of hedging some or all of our anticipated exposure in connection with the Notes), may affect the levels of the Underlyings. Consequently, the levels of the Underlyings may change subsequent to the pricing date, which may adversely affect the market value of the Notes.   \n  \nWe, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, also expect to engage in hedging activities that could affect the levels of the Underlyings on the pricing date. In addition, these hedging activities, including the unwinding of a hedge, may decrease the market value of your Notes prior to maturity, and may affect the amounts to be paid on the Notes. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may purchase or otherwise acquire a long or short position in the Notes and may hold or resell the Notes. For example, BofAS may enter into these transactions in connection with any market making activities in which it engages. We cannot assure you that these activities will not adversely affect the levels of the Underlyings, the market value of your Notes prior to maturity or the amounts payable on the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **There may be potential conflicts of interest involving the calculation agent, which is an affiliate of ours.** We have the right to appoint and remove the calculation agent. One of our affiliates will be the calculation agent for the Notes and, as such, will make a variety of determinations relating to the Notes, including the amounts that will be paid on the Notes. Under some circumstances, these duties could result in a conflict of interest between its status as our affiliate and its responsibilities as calculation agent.  \n---|---  \n**_Underlying-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **The Notes are subject to risks associated with small-size capitalization companies.** The stocks comprising the RTY are issued by companies with small-sized market capitalization. The stock prices of small-size companies may be more volatile than stock prices of large capitalization companies. Small-size capitalization companies may be less able to withstand adverse economic, market, trade and competitive conditions relative to larger companies. Small-size capitalization companies may also be more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products or services.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The Notes are subject to risks associated with foreign securities markets.** The NDX and the NKY each include certain foreign equity securities. You should be aware that investments in securities linked to the value of foreign equity securities involve particular risks. The foreign securities markets comprising the NDX and the NKY may have less liquidity and may be more volatile than U.S. or other securities markets and market developments may affect foreign markets differently from U.S. or other securities markets. Direct or indirect government intervention to stabilize these foreign securities markets, as well as cross-shareholdings in foreign companies, may affect trading prices and volumes in these markets. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies than about those U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and foreign companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements that differ from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies.  \n---|---  \nPrices of securities in foreign countries are subject to political, economic, financial and social factors that apply in those geographical regions. These factors, which could negatively affect those securities markets, include the possibility of recent or future changes in a foreign government\u2019s economic and fiscal policies, the possible imposition of, or changes in, currency exchange laws or other laws or restrictions applicable to foreign companies or investments in foreign equity securities and the possibility of fluctuations in the rate of exchange between currencies, the possibility of outbreaks of hostility and political instability and the possibility of natural disaster or adverse public health developments in the region. Moreover, foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in important respects such as growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resources and self-sufficiency.\n\u2022 |  **The publisher or the sponsor of an Underlying may adjust that Underlying in a way that affects its levels, and the publisher or the sponsor has no obligation to consider your interests.** The publisher or the sponsor of an Underlying can add, delete, or substitute the components included in that Underlying or make other methodological changes that could change its level. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of your Notes.  \n---|---  \n**_Tax-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, and may be adverse to a holder of the Notes.** No statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the Notes or securities similar to the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are not certain. Under the terms of the Notes, you will have agreed with us to treat the Notes as contingent income-bearing single financial contracts, as described below under \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Summary\u2014General.\u201d If the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) were successful in asserting an alternative characterization for the Notes, the timing and character of income, gain or loss with respect to the Notes may differ. No ruling will be requested from the IRS with respect to the Notes and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the statements made in the section entitled \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Summary.\u201d **You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of investing in the Notes.**  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME AUTO-CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-13 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Auto-Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Nikkei 225\u00ae Index and the Russell 2000\u00ae Index   \n---  \nThe Underlyings\nAll disclosures contained in this pricing supplement regarding the Underlyings, including, without limitation, their make-up, method of calculation, and changes in their components, have been derived from publicly available sources.

None of us, the Guarantor, the calculation agent, or BofAS accepts any responsibility for the calculation, maintenance or publication of any Underlying or any successor index. None of us, the Guarantor, BofAS or any of our other affiliates makes any representation to you as to the future performance of the Underlyings. You should make your own investigation into the Underlyings.\n**The Nasdaq-100****\u00ae****Index**\nThe NDX is intended to measure the performance of the 100 largest domestic and international non-financial securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market (\"NASDAQ\") based on market capitalization. The NDX reflects companies across major industry groups including computer hardware and software, telecommunications, retail/wholesale trade and biotechnology. It does not contain securities of financial companies including investment companies.\nThe NDX began trading on January 31, 1985 at a base value of 125.00. The NDX is calculated and published by Nasdaq, Inc. In administering the NDX, Nasdaq, Inc. will exercise reasonable discretion as it deems appropriate.\n**_Underlying Stock Eligibility Criteria_**\nNDX eligibility is limited to specific security types only. The security types eligible for the NDX include foreign or domestic common stocks, ordinary shares, ADRs and tracking stocks. Security types not included in the NDX are closed-end funds, convertible debt securities, exchange traded funds, limited liability companies, limited partnership interests, preferred stocks, rights, shares or units of beneficial interest, warrants, units, and other derivative securities. The NDX does not contain securities of investment companies. For purposes of the NDX eligibility criteria, if the security is a depositary receipt representing a security of a non-U.S. issuer, then references to the \u201cissuer\u201d are references to the issuer of the underlying security.\n_Initial Eligibility Criteria_\nTo be eligible for initial inclusion in the NDX, a security must be listed on NASDAQ and meet the following criteria:\n\u2022 |  the security\u2019s U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market (unless the security was dually listed on another U.S. market prior to January 1, 2004 and has continuously maintained such listing);  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security must be of a non-financial company;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy proceedings;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security must have a minimum three-month average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  if the issuer of the security is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the U.S., then such security must have listed options on a recognized options market in the U.S. or be eligible for listed-options trading on a recognized options market in the U.S.;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the issuer of the security may not have entered into a definitive agreement or other arrangement which would likely result in the security no longer being eligible for inclusion in the NDX;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements with an audit opinion that is currently withdrawn; and  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the issuer of the security must have \u201cseasoned\u201d on NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange or NYSE Amex. Generally, a company is considered to be seasoned if it has been listed on a market for at least three full months (excluding the first month of initial listing).  \n---|---  \n_Continued Eligibility Criteria_\nIn addition, to be eligible for continued inclusion in the NDX, the following criteria apply:\n\u2022 |  the security\u2019s U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security must be of a non-financial company;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy proceedings;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security must have a minimum three-month average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  if the issuer of the security is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the U.S., then such security must have listed options on a recognized options market in the U.S. or be eligible for listed-options trading on a recognized options market in the U.S. (measured annually during the ranking review process);  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security must have an adjusted market capitalization equal to or exceeding 0.10% of the aggregate adjusted market capitalization of the NDX at each month-end. In the event a company does not meet this criterion for two consecutive month-ends, it will be removed from the NDX effective after the close of trading on the third Friday of the following month; and  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME AUTO-CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-14 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Auto-Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Nikkei 225\u00ae Index and the Russell 2000\u00ae Index   \n---  \n\u2022 |  the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements with an audit opinion that is currently withdrawn.  \n---|---  \n**_Computation of the NDX_**\nThe value of the NDX equals the aggregate value of the NDX share weights (the \u201cNDX Shares\u201d) of each of the NDX securities multiplied by each such security\u2019s last sale price (last sale price refers to the last sale price on NASDAQ), and divided by the divisor of the NDX. If trading in an NDX security is halted while the market is open, the last traded price for that security is used for all NDX computations until trading resumes. If trading is halted before the market is open, the previous day\u2019s last sale price is used. The formula for determining the NDX value is as follows:\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_009.jpg)\nThe NDX is ordinarily calculated without regard to cash dividends on NDX securities. The NDX is calculated during the trading day and is disseminated once per second from 09:30:01 to 17:16:00 ET. The closing level of the NDX may change up until 17:15:00 ET due to corrections to the last sale price of the NDX securities. The official closing value of the NDX is ordinarily disseminated at 17:16:00 ET.\n**_NDX Maintenance_**\n_Changes to NDX Constituents_\nChanges to the NDX constituents may be made during the annual ranking review. In addition, if at any time during the year other than the annual review, it is determined that an NDX security issuer no longer meets the criteria for continued inclusion in the NDX, or is otherwise determined to have become ineligible for continued inclusion in the NDX, it is replaced with the largest market capitalization issuer not currently in the NDX that meets the applicable eligibility criteria for initial inclusion in the NDX.\nOrdinarily, a security will be removed from the NDX at its last sale price. However, if at the time of its removal the NDX security is halted from trading on its primary listing market and an official closing price cannot readily be determined, the NDX security may, in Nasdaq, Inc.\u2019s discretion, be removed at a price of $0.00000001 (\u201czero price\u201d). This zero price will be applied to the NDX security after the close of the market but prior to the time the official closing value of the NDX is disseminated.\n_Divisor Adjustments_\nThe divisor is adjusted to ensure that changes in the NDX constituents either by corporate actions (that adjust either the price or shares of an NDX security) or NDX participation outside of trading hours do not affect the value of the NDX. All divisor changes occur after the close of the applicable index security markets.\n_Quarterly NDX Rebalancing_\nThe NDX will be rebalanced on a quarterly basis if it is determined that (1) the current weight of the single NDX security with the largest market capitalization is greater than 24.0% of the NDX or (2) the collective weight of those securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5% exceeds 48.0% of the NDX. In addition, a \u201cspecial rebalancing\u201d of the NDX may be conducted at any time if Nasdaq, Inc. determines it necessary to maintain the integrity and continuity of the NDX. If either one or both of the above weight distribution conditions are met upon quarterly review, or Nasdaq, Inc. determines that a special rebalancing is necessary, a weight rebalancing will be performed.\nIf the first weight distribution condition is met and the current weight of the single NDX security with the largest market capitalization is greater than 24.0%, then the weights of all securities with current weights greater than 1.0% (\u201clarge securities\u201d) will be scaled down proportionately toward 1.0% until the adjusted weight of the single largest NDX security reaches 20.0%.\nIf the second weight distribution condition is met and the collective weight of those securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5% (or adjusted weights in accordance with the previous step, if applicable) exceeds 48.0% of the NDX, then the weights of all such large securities in that group will be scaled down proportionately toward 1.0% until their collective weight, so adjusted, is equal to 40.0%.\nThe aggregate weight reduction among the large securities resulting from either or both of the rebalancing steps above will then be redistributed to those securities with weightings of less than 1.0% (\u201csmall securities\u201d) in the following manner. In the first iteration, the weight of the largest small security will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal to the average NDX weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller remaining small securities will be scaled up by the same factor reduced in relation to each security\u2019s relative ranking among the small securities such that the smaller the NDX security in the ranking, the less its weight will be scaled upward. This is intended to reduce the market impact of the weight rebalancing on the smallest component securities in the NDX.\nIn the second iteration of the small security rebalancing, the weight of the second largest small security, already adjusted in the first iteration, will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal to the average NDX weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller remaining small securities will be scaled up by this same factor reduced in relation to each security\u2019s relative ranking among the small securities such that, once again, the smaller the security in the ranking, the less its weight will be scaled upward. Additional iterations will be performed until the accumulated increase in weight among\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME AUTO-CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-15 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Auto-Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Nikkei 225\u00ae Index and the Russell 2000\u00ae Index   \n---  \nthe small securities equals the aggregate weight reduction among the large securities that resulted from the rebalancing in accordance with the two weight distribution conditions discussed above.\nFinally, to complete the rebalancing process, once the final weighting percentages for each NDX security have been set, the NDX Shares will be determined anew based upon the last sale prices and aggregate capitalization of the NDX at the close of trading on the last calendar day in February, May, August and November. Changes to the NDX Shares will be made effective after the close of trading on the third Friday in March, June, September and December, and an adjustment to the divisor is made to ensure continuity of the NDX. Ordinarily, new rebalanced NDX Shares will be determined by applying the above procedures to the current NDX Shares. However, Nasdaq, Inc. may, from time to time, determine rebalanced weights, if necessary, by applying the above procedure to the actual current market capitalization of the NDX components. In such instances, Nasdaq, Inc. would announce the different basis for rebalancing prior to its implementation.\nDuring the quarterly rebalancing, data is cutoff as of the previous month end and no changes are made to the NDX from that cutoff until the quarterly index share change effective date, except in the case of changes due to corporate actions with an ex-date.\n**_Adjustments for Corporate Actions_**\nChanges in the price and/or NDX Shares driven by corporate events such as stock dividends, splits, and certain spin-offs and rights issuances will be adjusted on the ex-date. If the change in total shares outstanding arising from other corporate actions is greater than or equal to 10.0%, the change will be made as soon as practicable. Otherwise, if the change in total shares outstanding is less than 10.0%, then all such changes are accumulated and made effective at one time on a quarterly basis after the close of trading on the third Friday in each of March, June, September, and December. The NDX Shares are derived from the security\u2019s total shares outstanding. The NDX Shares are adjusted by the same percentage amount by which the total shares outstanding have changed.\n**Historical Performance of the NDX**\nThe following graph sets forth the daily historical performance of the NDX in the period from January 2, 2020 through October 15, 2025.

The NKY measures the composite price performance of selected Japanese stocks. The NKY is currently based on 225 stocks (each, an \u201cIndex Stock\u201d) trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (\u201cTSE\u201d) and represents a broad cross-section of Japanese industry. All 225 of the Index Stocks are listed in the First Section of the TSE. Index Stocks listed in the First Section are among the most actively traded stocks on the TSE. The NKY started on September 7, 1950. However, it was retroactively calculated back to May 16, 1949, when the TSE reopened for the first time after World War II.\nCalculation of the NKY\nThe NKY is a modified, price-weighted index. Each Index Stock\u2019s weight is based on its price per share rather than the total market capitalization of the issuer. Nikkei Inc. calculates the NKY by multiplying the per share price of each Index Stock by the corresponding weighting factor for that Index Stock (a \u201cWeight Factor\u201d), calculating the sum of all these products and dividing that sum by a divisor. The divisor is subject to periodic adjustments as set forth below. Each Weight Factor is computed by dividing 50 by the presumed par value of the relevant Index Stock, so that the share price of each Index Stock when multiplied by its Weight Factor corresponds to a share price based on a uniform par value of 50. Each Weight Factor represents the number of shares of the related Index Stock which are included in one trading unit of the NKY. The stock prices used in the calculation of the NKY are those reported by a primary market for the Index Stocks, currently the TSE. The level of the NKY is currently calculated once per 15 seconds during TSE trading hours.\nIn order to maintain continuity in the level of the NKY in the event of certain changes due to non-market factors affecting the Index Stocks, such as the addition or deletion of stocks, stock splits, or increase in paid-in capital, the divisor used in calculating the NKY is adjusted in a manner designed to prevent any instantaneous change or discontinuity in the level of the NKY. The divisor remains at the new value until a further adjustment is necessary as the result of another change. In the event of a change affecting any Index Stock, the divisor is adjusted in such a way that the sum of all share prices immediately after the change multiplied by the applicable Weight Factor and divided by the new divisor, i.e., the level of the NKY immediately after the change, will equal the level of the NKY immediately prior to the change.\n_Index Maintenance_\nThe NKY is reviewed annually at the beginning of October. The purpose of the review is to maintain the representative nature of the Index Stocks. Stocks with high market liquidity are added and those with low liquidity are deleted. At the same time, to take changes in industry structure into account, the balance of the sectors, in terms of the number of constituents, is considered. Liquidity of a stock is assessed by the two measures: \u201ctrading value\u201d and \u201cmagnitude of price fluctuation by volume,\u201d which is calculated as (high price/low price) / volume. Among stocks on the TSE First Section, the top 450 stocks in terms of liquidity are selected to form the \u201chigh liquidity group\u201d. Those constituents that are not in the high liquidity group are deleted. Those non-constituent stocks which are in the top 75 of the high liquidity group are added.\nAfter the liquidity deletions and additions, constituents are deleted and added to balance the number of constituents among sectors, and to make the total number of the constituents equal 225. Among the 450 \u201chigh liquidity\u201d stocks, half of those that belong to a sector are designated as the \u201cappropriate number of stocks\u201d for that sector. The actual number of constituents in a sector is then compared with its \u201cappropriate number,\u201d and if the actual number is larger or smaller than the \u201cappropriate number,\u201d then components are deleted or added, as necessary. Stocks to be deleted are selected from stocks with lower liquidity and stocks to be added are selected from stocks with higher liquidity. Stocks selected according to the foregoing procedures are candidates for addition or deletion, as applicable, and the final determinations will be made by Nikkei Inc.\nThe NKY is also reviewed on an ongoing basis in response to extraordinary developments, such as bankruptcies or mergers. Any stock becoming ineligible for listing in the TSE First Section due to any of the following reasons will be removed from the NKY: (i) bankruptcy and liquidation events; (ii) corporate restructurings, such as mergers, share exchanges or share transfers; (iii) excess debt or other reasons; or (iv) transfer to the TSE Second Section. In addition, a component stock designated as \u201csecurity under supervision\u201d becomes a deletion candidate. However, the decision to delete such a candidate will be made by examining the sustainability and the probability of delisting for each individual case. Upon deletion of a stock from the NKY, Nikkei Inc. will generally select as a replacement the most liquid stock that is both in the \u201chigh liquidity group\u201d and in the same sector as the deleted stock. When deletions are known in advance, replacements may be selected as part of the periodic review process or by using similar procedures.\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange\nThe TSE is one of the world\u2019s largest securities exchanges in terms of market capitalization. Trading hours for most products listed on the TSE are currently from 9:00 A.M. to 11:00 A.M. and from 12:30 P.M. to 3:00 P.M., Tokyo time, Monday through Friday.\nDue to the time zone difference, on any normal trading day, the TSE will close prior to the opening of business in New York City on the same calendar day. Therefore, the closing level of the NKY on a trading day will generally be available in the U.S. by the opening of business on the same calendar day.\nThe TSE has adopted certain measures, including daily price floors and ceilings on individual stocks, intended to prevent any extreme short-term price fluctuations resulting from order imbalances. In general, any stock listed on the TSE cannot be traded at a price lower than the applicable price floor or higher than the applicable price ceiling. These price floors and ceilings are expressed in absolute Japanese yen, rather than percentage limits based on\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME AUTO-CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-18 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Auto-Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Nikkei 225\u00ae Index and the Russell 2000\u00ae Index   \n---  \nthe closing price of the stock on the previous trading day. In addition, when there is a major order imbalance in a listed stock, the TSE posts a \u201cspecial bid quote\u201d or a \u201cspecial asked quote\u201d for that stock at a specified higher or lower price level than the stock\u2019s last sale price in order to solicit counter-orders and balance supply and demand for the stock. The TSE may also suspend the trading of individual stocks in certain limited and extraordinary circumstances, including, for example, unusual trading activity in that stock. As a result, changes in the NKY may be limited by price limitations or special quotes, or by suspension of trading, on individual stocks that make up the NKY, and these limitations, in turn, may adversely affect the market value of the Notes.\n**Historical Performance of the NKY**\nThe following graph sets forth the daily historical performance of the NKY in the period from January 2, 2020 through October 15, 2025.

Additional information on the RTY is available at the following website: http://www.ftserussell.com. No information on that website is deemed to be included or incorporated by reference in this pricing supplement.\nRussell began dissemination of the RTY on January 1, 1984. FTSE Russell calculates and publishes the RTY. The RTY was set to 135 as of the close of business on December 31, 1986. The RTY is designed to track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. As a subset of the Russell 3000\u00ae Index, the RTY consists of the smallest 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000\u00ae Index. The Russell 3000\u00ae Index measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies, representing approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market. The RTY is determined, comprised, and calculated by FTSE Russell without regard to the Notes.\n**_Selection of Stocks Comprising the RTY_**\nEach company eligible for inclusion in the RTY must be classified as a U.S. company under FTSE Russell\u2019s country-assignment methodology. If a company is incorporated, has a stated headquarters location, and trades in the same country (American Depositary Receipts and American Depositary Shares are not eligible), then the company is assigned to its country of incorporation. If any of the three factors are not the same, FTSE Russell defines three Home Country Indicators (\u201cHCIs\u201d): country of incorporation, country of headquarters, and country of the most liquid exchange (as defined by a two-year average daily dollar trading volume) from all exchanges within a country. Using the HCIs, FTSE Russell compares the primary location of the company\u2019s assets with the three HCIs. If the primary location of its assets matches any of the HCIs, then the company is assigned to the primary location of its assets. If there is insufficient information to determine the country in which the company\u2019s assets are primarily located, FTSE Russell will use the country from which the company\u2019s revenues are primarily derived for the comparison with the three HCIs in a similar manner. FTSE Russell uses the average of two years of assets or revenues data to reduce potential turnover. If conclusive country details cannot be derived from assets or revenues data, FTSE Russell will assign the company to the country of its headquarters, which is defined as the address of the company\u2019s principal executive offices, unless that country is a Benefit Driven Incorporation (\u201cBDI\u201d) country, in which case the company will be assigned to the country of its most liquid stock exchange. BDI countries include: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Bonaire, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cook Islands, Curacao, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Liberia, Marshall Islands, Panama, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Turks and Caicos Islands. For any companies incorporated or headquartered in a U.S. territory, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. HCI is assigned.\nAll securities eligible for inclusion in the RTY must trade on a major U.S. exchange. Stocks must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on their primary exchange on the last trading day in May to be eligible for inclusion during annual reconstitution. However, in order to reduce unnecessary turnover, if an existing member\u2019s closing price is less than $1.00 on the last day of May, it will be considered eligible if the average of the daily closing prices (from its primary exchange) during the month of May is equal to or greater than $1.00. Initial public offerings are added each quarter and must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on the last day of their eligibility period in order to qualify for index inclusion. If an existing stock does not trade on the \u201crank day\u201d (typically the last trading day in May but a confirmed timetable is announced each spring) but does have a closing price at or above $1.00 on another eligible U.S. exchange, that stock will be eligible for inclusion.\nAn important criterion used to determine the list of securities eligible for the RTY is total market capitalization, which is defined as the market price as of the last trading day in May for those securities being considered at annual reconstitution times the total number of shares outstanding. Where applicable, common stock, non-restricted exchangeable shares and partnership units/membership interests are used to determine market capitalization. Any other form of shares such as preferred stock, convertible preferred stock, redeemable shares, participating preferred stock, warrants and rights, installment receipts or trust receipts, are excluded from the calculation. If multiple share classes of common stock exist, they are combined. In cases where the common stock share classes act independently of each other (e.g., tracking stocks), each class is considered for inclusion separately. If multiple share classes exist, the pricing vehicle will be designated as the share class with the highest two-year trading volume as of the rank day in May.\nCompanies with a total market capitalization of less than $30 million are not eligible for the RTY. Similarly, companies with only 5% or less of their shares available in the marketplace are not eligible for the RTY. Royalty trusts, limited liability companies, closed-end investment companies (companies that are required to report Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, as defined by the SEC, including business development companies), blank check companies, special purpose acquisition companies, and limited partnerships are also ineligible for inclusion. Bulletin board, pink sheets, and over-the-counter traded securities are not eligible for inclusion. Exchange traded funds and mutual funds are also excluded.\nAnnual reconstitution is a process by which the RTY is completely rebuilt. Based on closing levels of the company\u2019s common stock on its primary exchange on the rank day of May of each year, FTSE Russell reconstitutes the composition of the RTY using the then existing market capitalizations of eligible companies. Reconstitution of the RTY occurs on the last Friday in June or, when the last Friday in June is the 29th or 30th, reconstitution occurs on the prior Friday. In addition, FTSE Russell adds initial public offerings to the RTY on a quarterly basis based on total market capitalization ranking within the market-adjusted capitalization breaks established during the most recent reconstitution. After membership is determined, a security\u2019s shares are adjusted to include only those shares available to the public. This is often referred to as \u201cfree float.\u201d The purpose of the adjustment is to exclude from market calculations the capitalization that is not available for purchase and is not part of the investable opportunity set.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME AUTO-CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-20 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Auto-Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Nikkei 225\u00ae Index and the Russell 2000\u00ae Index   \n---  \n**Historical Performance of the RTY**\nThe following graph sets forth the daily historical performance of the RTY in the period from January 2, 2020 through October 15, 2025.

(\u201cFINRA\u201d) and will participate as selling agent in the distribution of the Notes. Accordingly, the offering of the Notes will conform to the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121. BofAS may not make sales in this offering to any of its discretionary accounts without the prior written approval of the account holder.\nWe expect to deliver the Notes against payment therefor in New York, New York on a date that is greater than one business day following the pricing date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, if the initial settlement of the Notes occurs more than one business day from the pricing date, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than one business day prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.\nUnder our distribution agreement with BofAS, BofAS will purchase the Notes from us as principal at the public offering price indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, less the indicated underwriting discount, if any. BofAS will sell the Notes to other broker-dealers that will participate in the offering and that are not affiliated with us, at an agreed discount to the principal amount. Each of those broker-dealers may sell the Notes to one or more additional broker-dealers. BofAS has informed us that these discounts may vary from dealer to dealer and that not all dealers will purchase or repurchase the Notes at the same discount. Certain dealers who purchase the Notes for sale to certain fee-based advisory accounts may forgo some or all of their selling concessions, fees or commissions. The public offering price for investors purchasing the Notes in these fee-based advisory accounts may be as low as $990.00 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes.\nBofAS and any of our other broker-dealer affiliates may use this pricing supplement and the accompanying product supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus for offers and sales in secondary market transactions and market-making transactions in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to engage in such secondary market transactions and/or market-making transactions. These broker-dealer affiliates may act as principal or agent in these transactions, and any such sales will be made at prices related to prevailing market conditions at the time of the sale.\nAt BofAS\u2019s discretion, for a short, undetermined initial period after the issuance of the Notes, BofAS may offer to buy the Notes in the secondary market at a price that may exceed the initial estimated value of the Notes. Any price offered by BofAS for the Notes will be based on then-prevailing market conditions and other considerations, including the performance of the Underlyings and the remaining term of the Notes. However, none of us, the Guarantor, BofAS or any of our other affiliates is obligated to purchase your Notes at any price or at any time, and we cannot assure you that any party will purchase your Notes at a price that equals or exceeds the initial estimated value of the Notes.\nAny price that BofAS may pay to repurchase the Notes will depend upon then prevailing market conditions, the creditworthiness of us and the Guarantor, and transaction costs. At certain times, this price may be higher than or lower than the initial estimated value of the Notes.\n**European Economic Area and United Kingdom**\nNone of this pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying prospectus or the accompanying prospectus supplement is a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation (as defined below).

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended (the \u201cPRIIPs Regulation\u201d) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.\n**United Kingdom**\nThe communication of this pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying prospectus supplement, the accompanying\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME AUTO-CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-23 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Auto-Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Nikkei 225\u00ae Index and the Russell 2000\u00ae Index   \n---  \nprospectus and any other document or materials relating to the issue of the Notes offered hereby is not being made, and such documents and/or materials have not been approved, by an authorized person for the purposes of Section 21 of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the \u201cFSMA\u201d).

The related guarantee is BAC\u2019s obligation. As is the case for all of our and BAC\u2019s respective debt securities, including our market-linked notes, the economic terms of the Notes reflect our and BAC\u2019s actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition, because market-linked notes result in increased operational, funding and liability management costs to us and BAC, BAC typically borrows the funds under these types of notes at a rate, which we refer to in this pricing supplement as BAC\u2019s internal funding rate, that is more favorable to BAC than the rate that it might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security. This generally relatively lower internal funding rate, which is reflected in the economic terms of the Notes, along with the fees and charges associated with market-linked notes, typically results in the initial estimated value of the Notes on the pricing date being less than their public offering price.\nIn order to meet our payment obligations on the Notes, at the time we issue the Notes, we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options, put options or other derivatives) with BofAS or one of our other affiliates. The terms of these hedging arrangements are determined based upon terms provided by BofAS and its affiliates, and take into account a number of factors, including our and BAC\u2019s creditworthiness, interest rate movements, the volatility of the Underlyings, the tenor of the Notes and the hedging arrangements. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.\nBofAS has advised us that the hedging arrangements will include hedging related charges, reflecting the costs associated with, and our affiliates\u2019 profit earned from, these hedging arrangements. Since hedging entails risk and may be influenced by unpredictable market forces, actual profits or losses from these hedging transactions may be more or less than any expected amounts.\nFor further information, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page PS-5 and \u201cSupplemental Use of Proceeds\u201d on page PS-20 of the accompanying product supplement.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017618/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME AUTO-CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-25 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Auto-Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Nikkei 225\u00ae Index and the Russell 2000\u00ae Index   \n---  \nU.S. Federal Income Tax Summary\nThe following summary of the material U.S. federal income and estate tax considerations of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Notes supplements, and to the extent inconsistent supersedes, the discussion under \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d in the accompanying prospectus and is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), regulations promulgated under the Code by the U.S. Treasury Department (\u201cTreasury\u201d) (including proposed and temporary regulations), rulings, current administrative interpretations and official pronouncements of the IRS, and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. This summary does not include any description of the tax laws of any state or local governments, or of any foreign government, that may be applicable to a particular holder.\nAlthough the Notes are issued by us, they will be treated as if they were issued by BAC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly throughout this tax discussion, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d are generally to BAC unless the context requires otherwise.\nThis summary is directed solely to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders that, except as otherwise specifically noted, will purchase the Notes upon original issuance and will hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, which generally means property held for investment, and that are not excluded from the discussion under \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d in the accompanying prospectus.\nYou should consult your own tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the Notes, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, foreign, or other tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in U.S. federal or other tax laws.\n**General**\nAlthough there is no statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addressing the characterization of the Notes, we intend to treat the Notes for all tax purposes as contingent income-bearing single financial contracts with respect to the Underlyings and under the terms of the Notes, we and every investor in the Notes agree, in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary, to treat the Notes in accordance with such characterization. In the opinion of our counsel, Sidley Austin LLP, it is reasonable to treat the Notes as contingent income-bearing single financial contracts with respect to the Underlyings. This discussion assumes that the Notes constitute contingent income-bearing single financial contracts with respect to the Underlyings for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The economic terms of the Notes are based on BAC\u2019s internal funding rate, which is the rate it would pay to borrow funds through the issuance of market-linked notes, and the economic terms of certain related hedging arrangements BAC\u2019s affiliates enter into. BAC\u2019s internal funding rate is typically lower than the rate it would pay when it issues conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities. This difference in funding rate, as well as the underwriting discount, if any, the referral fee and the hedging related charges described below (see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page PS-11), will reduce the economic terms of the Notes to you and the initial estimated value of the Notes. Due to these factors, the public offering price you pay to purchase the Notes will be greater than the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the pricing date.\nThe initial estimated value range of the Notes is set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. The final pricing supplement will set forth the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the pricing date. For more information about the initial estimated value and the structuring of the Notes, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page PS-11 and \u201cStructuring the Notes\u201d on page PS-28.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-6 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \nContingent Coupon Payment and Redemption Amount Determination\n**On each Contingent Payment Date, if the Notes have not been previously called, you may receive a**\n**Contingent Coupon Payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes determined as follows:**\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_gt1.jpg)\n**Assuming the Notes have not been called,****on the Maturity Date, you will receive a cash payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes determined as follows:**\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_gt2.jpg)\nAll payments described above are subject to the credit risk of BofA Finance, as Issuer, and BAC, as Guarantor.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-7 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \nTotal Contingent Coupon Payment Examples\nThe examples below illustrate the hypothetical total Contingent Coupon Payments per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes over the term of the Notes, based on the Contingent Coupon Payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes equal to (i) the _product_ of $13.209 _times_ the number of Contingent Payment Dates that have occurred up to the relevant Contingent Payment Date (inclusive of the relevant Contingent Payment Date) _minus_ (ii) the sum of all Contingent Coupon Payments previously paid. Depending on the performance of the Underlyings, you may not receive any Contingent Coupon Payments during the term of the Notes.\n**Example 1** - The Observation Value of each Underlying on each of the first through eleventh Observation Dates is below its Coupon Barrier. Therefore, no Contingent Coupon Payment will be paid on the applicable Contingent Payment Dates. The Observation Value of each Underlying on the twelfth Observation Date is above its Coupon Barrier. Therefore, a Contingent Coupon Payment will be paid on the applicable Contingent Payment Date (which is also the first date on which the Notes may be called). However, the Notes are not called by the Issuer. The Contingent Coupon Payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes due on the related Contingent Payment Date will be calculated as follows:\n(i) the _product_ of $13.209 _times_ the number of Contingent Payment Dates that have occurred up to the relevant Contingent Payment Date (inclusive of the relevant Contingent Payment Date) minus (ii) the sum of all Contingent Coupon Payments previously paid.\n= (i) $13.209 x 12 - (ii) $0.000 = $158.508 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes.\nThe Observation Value of each Underlying on the thirteenth Observation Date is above its Coupon Barrier. In addition, the Notes are called by the Issuer on the thirteenth Contingent Payment Date. The Contingent Coupon Payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes otherwise due on the related Contingent Payment Date will be calculated as follows:\n(i) the _product_ of $13.209 _times_ the number of Contingent Payment Dates that have occurred up to the relevant Contingent Payment Date (inclusive of the relevant Contingent Payment Date) minus (ii) the sum of all Contingent Coupon Payments previously paid.\n= (i) $13.209 x 13 - (ii) $158.508 = $13.209 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes.\nOn the applicable Contingent Payment Date (which is also the Call Payment Date), you will receive $1,013.209 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes. No further amounts will be payable following an Optional Early Redemption.\n**Example 2** \u2013 The Observation Value of each Underlying on each of the first through eleventh Observation Dates is below its Coupon Barrier. Therefore, no Contingent Coupon Payment will be paid on the applicable Contingent Payment Dates.The Observation Value of each Underlying on the twelfth Observation Date is below its Coupon Barrier. Therefore, no Contingent Coupon Payment will be paid on the applicable Contingent Payment Date (which is also the first date on which the Notes may be called). In addition, the Notes are not called by the Issuer. The Observation Value of each Underlying on the thirteenth Observation Date is above its Coupon Barrier and the Notes are called by the Issuer on the thirteenth Contingent Payment Date. The Contingent Coupon Payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes due on the related Contingent Payment Date will be calculated as follows:\n(i) the _product_ of $13.209 _times_ the number of Contingent Payment Dates that have occurred up to the relevant Contingent Payment Date (inclusive of the relevant Contingent Payment Date) minus (ii) the sum of all Contingent Coupon Payments previously paid.\n= (i) $13.209 x 13 - (ii) $0.000 = $171.717 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes.\nOn the applicable Contingent Payment Date (which is also the Call Payment Date), you will receive $1,171.717 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes. No further amounts will be payable following an Optional Early Redemption.\n**Example 3** \u2013 The Observation Value of each Underlying on each of the first through eleventh Observation Dates is above its Coupon Barrier. Therefore, a Contingent Coupon Payment in the amount of $13.209 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes will be paid on each applicable Contingent Payment Date.The Observation Value of each Underlying on the twelfth Observation Date is above its Coupon Barrier. Therefore, a Contingent Coupon Payment will be paid on the related Contingent Payment Date (which is also the first date on which the Notes may be called). However, the Notes are not called by the Issuer. The Contingent Coupon Payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes due on the related Contingent Payment Date will be calculated as follows:\n(i) the _product_ of $13.209 _times_ the number of Contingent Payment Dates that have occurred up to the relevant Contingent Payment Date (inclusive of the relevant Contingent Payment Date) minus (ii) the sum of all Contingent Coupon Payments previously paid.\n= (i) $13.209 x 12 - (ii) $13.209 x 11 = $13.209 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-8 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \nThe Observation Value of each Underlying on each of the thirteenth through thirty-fifth Observation Dates is above its Coupon Barrier. Therefore, a Contingent Coupon Payment in the amount of $13.209 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes will be paid on each applicable Contingent Payment Date. However, the Notes are not called by the Issuer. The Ending Value of each Underlying on the Valuation Date is above its Coupon Barrier and Threshold Value. Therefore, a Contingent Coupon Payment will be due on the Maturity Date. The Contingent Coupon Payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes due on the related Contingent Payment Date will be calculated as follows:\n(i) the _product_ of $13.209 _times_ the number of Contingent Payment Dates that have occurred up to the relevant Contingent Payment Date (inclusive of the relevant Contingent Payment Date) minus (ii) the sum of all Contingent Coupon Payments previously paid.\n= (i) $13.209 x 36 - (ii) $13.209 x 35 = $13.209 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes.\nOn the Maturity Date, you will receive $1,013.209 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes.\n**Example 4** \u2013 The Observation Value of each Underlying on each of the first through eleventh Observation Dates is above its Coupon Barrier. A Contingent Coupon Payment in the amount of $13.209 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes will be paid on each applicable Contingent Payment Date.The Observation Value of each Underlying on each of the twelfth through thirty-fifth Observation Dates is below its Coupon Barrier. Therefore, no Contingent Coupon Payment will be payable on the related Contingent Payment Date. In addition, the Notes are not called by the Issuer. The Ending Value of each Underlying on the Valuation Date is below its Coupon Barrier and Threshold Value. Therefore, no Contingent Coupon Payment will be due on the Maturity Date, and you will receive an amount at maturity that will be less than the stated principal amount of your Notes, and could be zero.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-9 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \nHypothetical Payout Profile and Examples of Payments at Maturity\n**Contingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Table**\nThe following table is for purposes of illustration only.

Your decision to purchase the Notes should be made only after carefully considering the risks of an investment in the Notes, including those discussed below, with your advisors in light of your particular circumstances. The Notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about significant elements of the Notes or financial matters in general. You should carefully review the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections beginning on page PS-5 of the accompanying product supplement, page S-6 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and page 7 of the accompanying prospectus, each as identified on page PS-__32_ _below._\n**_Structure-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **Your investment may result in a loss; there is no guaranteed return of principal.** There is no fixed principal repayment amount on the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not called prior to maturity and the Ending Value of **any** Underlying is less than its Threshold Value, at maturity, your investment will be subject to 1:1 downside exposure to decreases in the value of the Least Performing Underlying and you will lose 1% of the principal amount for each 1% that the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Starting Value. In that case, you will lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Your return on the Notes is limited to the return represented by the Contingent Coupon Payments, if any, over the term of the Notes.** Your return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupon Payments paid over the term of the Notes, regardless of the extent to which the Observation Value or Ending Value of any Underlying exceeds its Coupon Barrier or Starting Value, as applicable. Similarly, the amount payable at maturity or upon an Optional Early Redemption will never exceed the sum of the principal amount and the applicable Contingent Coupon Payment, regardless of the extent to which the Observation Value or Ending Value of any Underlying exceeds its Starting Value. In contrast, a direct investment in the Underlyings or in the securities held or assets by or included in the Underlying would allow you to receive the benefit of any appreciation in their values. Any return on the Notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned those securities or assets and received the dividends paid or distributions made on them.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The Notes are subject to Optional Early Redemption, which would limit your ability to receive the Contingent Coupon Payments over the full term of the Notes.** On each Call Payment Date, at our option, we may call your Notes in whole, but not in part. If the Notes are called prior to the Maturity Date, you will be entitled to receive the Early Redemption Amount on the applicable Call Payment Date, and no further amounts will be payable on the Notes. In this case, you will lose the opportunity to continue to receive Contingent Coupon Payments after the date of the Optional Early Redemption. If the Notes are called prior to the Maturity Date, you may be unable to invest in other securities with a similar level of risk that could provide a return that is similar to the Notes. Even if we do not exercise our option to call your Notes, our ability to do so may adversely affect the market value of your Notes. It is our sole option whether to call your Notes prior to maturity on any such Call Payment Date and we may or may not exercise this option for any reason. Because of this Optional Early Redemption potential, the term of your Notes could be anywhere between twelve and thirty-six months.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **You may not receive any Contingent Coupon Payments.** The Notes do not provide for any regular fixed coupon payments. Investors in the Notes will not necessarily receive any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes. If the Observation Value of any Underlying is less than its Coupon Barrier on an Observation Date, you will not receive the Contingent Coupon Payment on the related Coupon Payment Date. You will receive a previously unpaid Contingent Coupon Payment on a subsequent Coupon Payment Date only if the Observation Value of each Underlying on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier. However, if the Observation Value of any Underlying on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier and the Observation Value of any Underlying on each subsequent Observation Date up to and including the Valuation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier, you will not receive the unpaid Contingent Coupon Payments in respect of those Observation Dates. If the Observation Value of any Underlying is less than its Coupon Barrier on all the Observation Dates during the term of the Notes, you will not receive any Contingent Coupon Payments during the term of the Notes, and will not receive a positive return on the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Your return on the Notes may be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.** Any return that you receive on the Notes may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased a conventional debt security with the same Maturity Date. As a result, your investment in the Notes may not reflect the full opportunity cost to you when you consider factors, such as inflation, that affect the time value of money. In addition, if interest rates increase during the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon Payment (if any) may be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The Contingent Coupon Payment, Early Redemption Amount or Redemption Amount, as applicable, will not reflect changes in the prices of the Underlyings other than on the Observation Dates.** The prices of the Underlyings during the term of the Notes other than on the Observation Dates will not affect payments on the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, investors should generally be aware of the performance of the Underlyings while holding the Notes, as the performance of the Underlyings may influence the market value of the Notes. The calculation agent will determine whether each Contingent Coupon Payment is payable and will calculate the Early Redemption Amount or the Redemption Amount, as applicable, by comparing only the Starting Value, the Coupon Barrier or the Threshold Value, as applicable, to the Observation Value or the Ending Value for each Underlying. No other prices of the Underlyings will be taken into account. As a result, if the Notes are not called prior to maturity and the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Threshold Value, you will receive less than the principal amount at maturity even if the price of each Underlying was always above its Threshold Value prior to the Valuation Date.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Because the Notes are linked to the least performing (and not the average performance) of the Underlyings, you may not**  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-11 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \n|  **receive any return on the Notes and may lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes even if the Observation Value or Ending Value of one Underlying is greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier or Threshold Value, as applicable.** Your Notes are linked to the least performing of the Underlyings, and a change in the price of one Underlying may not correlate with changes in the prices of the other Underlyings. The Notes are not linked to a basket composed of the Underlyings, where the depreciation in the price of one Underlying could be offset to some extent by the appreciation in the prices of the other Underlyings. In the case of the Notes, the individual performance of each Underlying would not be combined, and the depreciation in the price of one Underlying would not be offset by any appreciation in the prices of the other Underlyings. Even if the Observation Value of an Underlying is at or above its Coupon Barrier on an Observation Date, you will not receive the Contingent Coupon Payment with respect to that Observation Date if the Observation Value of another Underlying is below its Coupon Barrier on that day. In addition, even if the Ending Value of an Underlying is at or above its Threshold Value, you will lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes if the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is below its Threshold Value.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Any payments on the Notes are subject to our credit risk and the credit risk of the Guarantor, and any actual or perceived changes in our or the Guarantor\u2019s creditworthiness are expected to affect the value of the Notes.** The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. Any payment on the Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor. The Notes are not guaranteed by any entity other than the Guarantor. As a result, your receipt of any payments on the Notes will be dependent upon our ability and the ability of the Guarantor to repay our respective obligations under the Notes on the applicable payment date, regardless of the performance of the Underlyings. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition or the financial condition of the Guarantor will be at any time after the pricing date of the Notes. If we and the Guarantor become unable to meet our respective financial obligations as they become due, you may not receive the amount(s) payable under the terms of the Notes.   \n  \nIn addition, our credit ratings and the credit ratings of the Guarantor are assessments by ratings agencies of our respective abilities to pay our obligations. Consequently, our or the Guarantor\u2019s perceived creditworthiness and actual or anticipated decreases in our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit ratings or increases in the spread between the yield on our respective securities and the yield on U.S. Treasury securities (the \u201ccredit spread\u201d) prior to the Maturity Date may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. However, because your return on the Notes depends upon factors in addition to our ability and the ability of the Guarantor to pay our respective obligations, such as the values of the Underlyings, an improvement in our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit ratings will not reduce the other investment risks related to the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **We are a finance subsidiary and, as such, have no independent assets, operations, or revenues.** We are a finance subsidiary of the Guarantor, have no operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of our debt securities that are guaranteed by the Guarantor, and are dependent upon the Guarantor and/or its other subsidiaries to meet our obligations under the Notes in the ordinary course. Therefore, our ability to make payments on the Notes may be limited.  \n---|---  \n**_Valuation and Market-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **The public offering price you pay for the Notes will exceed their initial estimated value.** The range of initial estimated values of the Notes that is provided on the cover page of this preliminary pricing supplement, and the initial estimated value as of the pricing date that will be provided in the final pricing supplement, are each estimates only, determined as of a particular point in time by reference to our and our affiliates\u2019 pricing models. These pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables, including our credit spreads and those of the Guarantor, the Guarantor\u2019s internal funding rate, mid-market terms on hedging transactions, expectations on interest rates, dividends and volatility, price-sensitivity analysis, and the expected term of the Notes. These pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity, their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and lower than their initial estimated value. This is due to, among other things, changes in the prices of the Underlyings, changes in the Guarantor\u2019s internal funding rate, and the inclusion in the public offering price of the underwriting discount, if any, the referral fee and the hedging related charges, all as further described in \u201cStructuring the Notes\u201d below. These factors, together with various credit, market and economic factors over the term of the Notes, are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The initial estimated value does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which we, BAC, BofAS or any of our other affiliates would be willing to purchase your Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time.** The value of your Notes at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy, including the performance of the Underlyings, our and BAC\u2019s creditworthiness and changes in market conditions.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **We cannot assure you that a trading market for your Notes will ever develop or be maintained.** We will not list the Notes on any securities exchange. We cannot predict how the Notes will trade in any secondary market or whether that market will be liquid or illiquid.  \n---|---  \n**_Conflict-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **Trading and hedging activities by us, the Guarantor and any of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may create conflicts of interest with you and may affect your return on the Notes and their market value.** We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may buy or sell shares or units of the Underlyings or the securities or assets held by or included in the Underlyings, as applicable, or futures or options contracts or exchange traded instruments on the Underlyings or those securities, or  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-12 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \n|  other instruments whose value is derived from the Underlyings or those securities or assets . While we, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may from time to time own shares or units of the Underlyings or securities or assets represented by the Underlyings, except to the extent that BAC\u2019s common stock may be included in the Underlyings, we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, do not control any company included in the Underlyings, and have not verified any disclosure made by any other company. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may execute such purchases or sales for our own or their own accounts, for business reasons, or in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes. These transactions may present a conflict of interest between your interest in the Notes and the interests we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, may have in our or their proprietary accounts, in facilitating transactions, including block trades, for our or their other customers, and in accounts under our or their management. These transactions may adversely affect the prices of the Underlyings in a manner that could be adverse to your investment in the Notes. On or before the pricing date, any purchases or sales by us, the Guarantor or our other affiliates, including BofAS or others on our or their behalf (including those for the purpose of hedging some or all of our anticipated exposure in connection with the Notes), may affect the prices of the Underlyings. Consequently, the prices of the Underlyings may change subsequent to the pricing date, which may adversely affect the market value of the Notes.   \n  \nWe, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, also expect to engage in hedging activities that could affect the prices of the Underlyings on the pricing date. In addition, these hedging activities, including the unwinding of a hedge, may decrease the market value of your Notes prior to maturity, and may affect the amounts to be paid on the Notes. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may purchase or otherwise acquire a long or short position in the Notes and may hold or resell the Notes. For example, BofAS may enter into these transactions in connection with any market making activities in which it engages. We cannot assure you that these activities will not adversely affect the prices of the Underlyings, the market value of your Notes prior to maturity or the amounts payable on the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **There may be potential conflicts of interest involving the calculation agent, which is an affiliate of ours.** We have the right to appoint and remove the calculation agent. One of our affiliates will be the calculation agent for the Notes and, as such, will make a variety of determinations relating to the Notes, including the amounts that will be paid on the Notes. Under some circumstances, these duties could result in a conflict of interest between its status as our affiliate and its responsibilities as calculation agent.  \n---|---  \n**_Underlying-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **Adverse conditions in the energy sector may reduce your return on the Notes.** All of the stocks held by the XLE are issued by companies whose primary lines of business are directly associated with the energy sector. Issuers in energy-related industries can be significantly affected by fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of energy fuels. Markets for various energy-related commodities can have significant volatility, and are subject to control or manipulation by large producers or purchasers. Companies in the energy sector may need to make substantial expenditures, and to incur significant amounts of debt, in order to maintain or expand their reserves. Oil and gas exploration and production can be significantly affected by natural disasters as well as changes in exchange rates, interest rates, government regulation, world events and economic conditions. These companies may be at risk for environmental damage claims. As a result of these factors, the value of the securities may be subject to greater volatility and be more adversely affected by economic, political, or regulatory events relating to the energy sector.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Adverse conditions in the health care sector may reduce your return on the Notes.** All of the securities held by the XLV are issued by companies whose primary lines of business are directly associated with the health care sector. The profitability of these companies is largely affected by restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure and an increased emphasis on outpatient services. Companies in the health care sector are heavily dependent on patent protection and the process of obtaining patent approval can be long and costly. The expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of the companies. Health care companies are also subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Companies in the health care sector are heavily dependent on obtaining and defending patents, which may be time consuming and costly, and the expiration of patents may also adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Health care companies are also subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. In addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in technologies or other market developments. As a result of these factors, the price of the XLV, and therefore the value of the securities, may be subject to greater volatility and be more adversely affected by economic, political, or regulatory events relating to the health care sector.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The Notes are subject to risks associated with the banking industry.** All of the stocks held by the KRE are issued by companies in the banking industry. The performance of companies in the banking industry are influenced by many complex and unpredictable factors, including industry competition, interest rates, geopolitical events, the ability of borrowers to repay loans, government regulation, and supply and demand for the products and services offered by such companies. Any adverse development in the banking industry may have a material adverse effect on the stocks held by the KRE, and as a result, on the value of the Notes. The Notes may be subject to greater volatility and be more adversely affected by a single positive or negative economic, political or regulatory occurrence affecting this industry than a different investment linked to securities of a more broadly diversified group of issuers.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The stocks of companies in the energy sector are subject to swift price fluctuations.** The issuers of the stocks held by the XLE develop and produce, among other things, crude oil and natural gas, and provide, among other things, drilling services and other services related to energy resources production and distribution. Stock prices for these types of companies are affected by supply and demand both for their specific product or service and for energy products in general. The price of oil and gas, exploration and production  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-13 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \n|  spending, government regulation, world events and economic conditions will likewise affect the performance of these companies. Correspondingly, the stocks of companies in the energy sector are subject to swift price fluctuations caused by events relating to international politics, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects and tax and other governmental regulatory policies. Weak demand for the companies\u2019 products or services or for energy products and services in general, as well as negative developments in these other areas, would adversely impact the value of the stocks held by the XLE and, therefore, the price of the XLE and the value of the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The stocks held by the XLE are concentrated in one sector.** The XLE holds securities issued by companies in the energy sector. As a result, some of the stocks that will determine the performance of the Notes are concentrated in one sector. Although an investment in the Notes will not give holders any ownership or other direct interests in the securities held by the XLE, the return on an investment in the Notes will be subject to certain risks associated with a direct equity investment in companies in this sector. Accordingly, by investing in the Notes, you will not benefit from the diversification which could result from an investment linked to companies that operate in multiple sectors.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The stocks held by the XLV are concentrated in one sector.** The XLV holds securities issued by companies in the health care sector. As a result, some of the stocks that will determine the performance of the Notes are concentrated in one sector. Although an investment in the Notes will not give holders any ownership or other direct interests in the securities held by the XLV, the return on an investment in the Notes will be subject to certain risks associated with a direct equity investment in companies in this sector. Accordingly, by investing in the Notes, you will not benefit from the diversification which could result from an investment linked to companies that operate in multiple sectors.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The stocks held by the KRE are concentrated in one sector.** The KRE holds securities issued by companies in the regional banking sector. As a result, some of the stocks that will determine the performance of the Notes are concentrated in one sector. Although an investment in the Notes will not give holders any ownership or other direct interests in the securities held by the KRE, the return on an investment in the Notes will be subject to certain risks associated with a direct equity investment in companies in this sector. Accordingly, by investing in the Notes, you will not benefit from the diversification which could result from an investment linked to companies that operate in multiple sectors.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The performance of an Underlying may not correlate with the performance of its underlying index as well as the net asset value per share or unit of the Underlying, especially during periods of market volatility.** The performance of an Underlying and that of its underlying index generally will vary due to, for example, transaction costs, management fees, certain corporate actions, and timing variances. Moreover, it is also possible that the performance of an Underlying may not fully replicate or may, in certain circumstances, diverge significantly from the performance of its underlying index. This could be due to, for example, the Underlying not holding all or substantially all of the underlying assets included in its underlying index and/or holding assets that are not included in its underlying index, the temporary unavailability of certain securities in the secondary market, the performance of any derivative instruments held by the Underlying, differences in trading hours between the Underlying (or the underlying assets held by the Underlying) and its underlying index, or other circumstances. This variation in performance is called the \u201ctracking error,\u201d and, at times, the tracking error may be significant. In addition, because the shares or units of each Underlying are traded on a securities exchange and are subject to market supply and investor demand, the market price of one share or unit of an Underlying may differ from its net asset value per share or unit; shares or units of the Underlying may trade at, above, or below its net asset value per share or unit. During periods of market volatility, securities held by an Underlying may be unavailable in the secondary market, market participants may be unable to calculate accurately the net asset value per share or unit of the Underlying and the liquidity of the Underlying may be adversely affected. Market volatility may also disrupt the ability of market participants to trade shares or units of the Underlying. Further, market volatility may adversely affect, sometimes materially, the prices at which market participants are willing to buy and sell shares or units of the Underlying. As a result, under these circumstances, the market value of shares or units of the Underlying may vary substantially from the net asset value per share or unit of the Underlying.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The anti-dilution adjustments will be limited.** The calculation agent may adjust the Price Multiplier of an Underlying and other terms of the Notes to reflect certain actions by an Underlying, as described in the section \u201cDescription of the Notes\u2014Anti-Dilution and Discontinuance Adjustments Relating to ETFs\u201d in the accompanying product supplement. The calculation agent will not be required to make an adjustment for every event that may affect an Underlying and will have broad discretion to determine whether and to what extent an adjustment is required.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The publisher or the sponsor or investment advisor of an Underlying may adjust that Underlying in a way that affects its prices, and the publisher or the sponsor or investment advisor has no obligation to consider your interests.** The publisher or the sponsor or investment advisor of an Underlying can add, delete, or substitute the components included in that Underlying or make other methodological changes that could change its price. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of your Notes.  \n---|---  \n**_Tax-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, and may be adverse to a holder of the Notes.** No statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the Notes or securities similar to the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are not certain. Under the terms of the Notes, you will have agreed with us to treat the Notes as contingent income-bearing single financial contracts, as described below under \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Summary\u2014General.\u201d If the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) were successful in asserting an alternative characterization for the Notes, the timing and character of  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-14 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \n|  income, gain or loss with respect to the Notes may differ.

The information reflects the policies of, and is subject to change by, the investment advisor of the XLE, the investment advisor of the XLV and the investment advisor of the KRE (collectively, the \u201cInvestment Advisors\u201d). The Investment Advisors, which license the copyright and all other rights to the respective Underlyings, have no obligation to continue to publish, and may discontinue publication of, the Underlyings. The consequences of any Investment Advisor discontinuing publication of the applicable Underlying are discussed in \u201cDescription of the Notes \u2014 Anti-Dilution and Discontinuance Adjustments Relating to ETFs \u2014 Discontinuance of or Material Change to an ETF\u201d in the accompanying product supplement. None of us, the Guarantor, the calculation agent, or BofAS accepts any responsibility for the calculation, maintenance or publication of any Underlying or any successor underlying. None of us, the Guarantor, BofAS or any of our other affiliates makes any representation to you as to the future performance of the Underlyings. You should make your own investigation into the Underlyings.\n**The Energy Select Sector SPDR****\u00ae****Fund**\nThe shares of the XLE are issued by Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Trust, a registered investment company. The XLE seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Energy Select Sector Index, its underlying index. The Energy Select Sector Index measures the performance of the energy sector of the U.S. equity market. The XLE is composed of equity securities of companies in the oil, gas and consumable fuel, energy equipment and services industries. The XLE trades on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol \u201cXLE.\u201d\n**_Investment Approach_**\nThe XLE utilizes a \u201cpassive\u201d or \u201cindexing\u201d investment approach in attempting to track the performance of the Energy Select Sector Index. The XLE will invest in substantially all of the securities which comprise the Energy Select Sector Index. The XLE will normally invest at least 95% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Energy Select Sector Index.\n**_Investment Objective and Strategy_**\nThe XLE seeks to provide investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Energy Select Sector Index. The investment manager of the XLE uses a replication strategy to try to achieve the XLE\u2019s investment objective, which means that the XLE generally invests in substantially all of the securities represented in the Energy Select Sector Index in approximately the same proportions as the Energy Select Sector Index. Under normal market conditions, the XLE generally invests at least 95% of its total assets in the securities comprising the Energy Select Sector Index. In certain situations or market conditions, the XLE may temporarily depart from its normal investment policies and strategies provided that the alternative is consistent with the XLE\u2019s investment objective and is in the best interest of the XLE. For example, if the XLE is unable to invest directly in a component security or if a derivative investment may provide higher liquidity than other types of investments, it may make larger than normal investments in derivatives to maintain exposure to the Energy Select Sector Index that it tracks. Consequently, under such circumstances, the XLE may invest in a different mix of investments than it would under normal circumstances. The XLE will provide shareholders with at least 60 days notice prior to any material change in its investment policies. The XLE is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities. This differs from an actively managed underlying, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index.\nNotwithstanding the XLE\u2019s investment objective, the return on your Notes will not reflect any dividends paid on shares of the XLE, on the securities purchased by the XLE or on the securities that comprise the Energy Select Sector Index.\n**_The Select Sector Indices_**\nThe underlying index of the XLE is part of the Select Sector Indices. The Select Sector Indices are sub-indices of the S&P 500\u00ae Index (\u201cSPX\u201d). Each stock in the SPX is allocated to at least one Select Sector Index, and the combined companies of the eleven Select Sector Indices represent all of the companies in the SPX. The industry indices are sub-categories within each Select Sector Index and represent a specific industry segment of the overall Select Sector Index. The eleven Select Sector Indices seek to represent the eleven SPX sectors. The index compilation agent for these indices (the \u201cIndex Compilation Agent\u201d) determines the composition of the Select Sector Indices based on S&P\u2019s sector classification methodology. (Sector designations are determined by the index sponsor using criteria it has selected or developed. Index sponsors may use very different standards for determining sector designations. In addition, many companies operate in a number of sectors, but are listed in only one sector and the basis on which that sector is selected may also differ. As a result, sector comparisons between indices with different index sponsors may reflect differences in methodology as well as actual differences in the sector composition of the indices.\nEach Select Sector Index was developed and is maintained in accordance with the following criteria:\n\u2022 |  Each of the component stocks in a Select Sector Index (the \u201cComponent Stocks\u201d) is a constituent company of the SPX.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  The eleven Select Sector Indices together will include all of the companies represented in the SPX and each of the stocks in the SPX will be allocated to at least one of the Select Sector Indices.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  The Index Compilation Agent assigns each constituent stock of the SPX to a Select Sector Index. The Index Compilation Agent assigns a  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-16 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \n|  company\u2019s stock to a particular Select Sector Index based on S&P Dow Jones Indices\u2019s sector classification methodology as set forth in its Global Industry Classification Standard.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  Each Select Sector Index is calculated by S&P Dow Jones Indices using a modified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d methodology. This design ensures that each of the component stocks within a Select Sector Index is represented in a proportion consistent with its percentage with respect to the total market capitalization of that Select Sector Index.  \n---|---  \nFor reweighting purposes, each Select Sector Index is rebalanced quarterly after the close of business on the second to last calculation day of March, June, September and December using the following procedures: (1) The rebalancing reference date is two business days prior to the last calculation day of each quarter; and (2) With prices reflected on the rebalancing reference date, and membership, shares outstanding, additional weight factor (capping factor) and investable weight factors (as described in the section \u201cComputation of the S&P 500 Index\u00ae\u201d below) as of the rebalancing effective date, each company is weighted using the modified market capitalization methodology. Modifications are made as defined below.\n(i) |  The indices are first evaluated to ensure none of the indices breach the maximum allowable limits defined in rules (ii) and (v) below. If any of the allowable limits are breached, the component stocks are reweighted based on their float-adjusted market capitalization weights.  \n---|---  \n(ii) |  If any component stock has a weight greater than 24%, that component stock has its float-adjusted market capitalization weight capped at 23%. The 23% weight cap creates a 2% buffer to ensure that no component stock exceeds 25% as of the quarter-end diversification requirement date.  \n---|---  \n(iii) |  All excess weight is equally redistributed to all uncapped component stocks within the relevant Select Sector Index.  \n---|---  \n(iv) |  After this redistribution, if the float-adjusted market capitalization weight of any other component stock(s) then breaches 23%, the process is repeated iteratively until no component stock breaches the 23% weight cap.  \n---|---  \n(v) |  The sum of the component stocks with weight greater than 4.8% cannot exceed 50% of the total index weight. These caps are set to allow for a buffer below the 5% limit.  \n---|---  \n(vi) |  If the rule in step (v) is breached, all the component stocks are ranked in descending order of their float-adjusted market capitalization weights and the first component stock that causes the 50% limit to be breached has its weight reduced to 4.6%.  \n---|---  \n(vii) |  This excess weight is equally redistributed to all component stocks with weights below 4.6%. This process is repeated iteratively until step (v) is satisfied.  \n---|---  \n(viii) |  Index share amounts are assigned to each component stock to arrive at the weights calculated above.

The SPX is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of common stock price movement. The calculation of the level of the SPX is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of 500 companies as of a particular time compared to the aggregate average market value of the common stocks of 500 similar companies during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943.\nThe SPX includes companies from eleven main groups: Communication Services; Consumer Discretionary; Consumer Staples; Energy; Financials; Health Care; Industrials; Information Technology; Real Estate; Materials; and Utilities.

As a result, the return on the Notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the SPX constituent stocks and received the dividends paid on those stocks.\n_Computation of the SPX_\nWhile SPDJI currently employs the following methodology to calculate the SPX, no assurance can be given that SPDJI will not modify or change this methodology in a manner that may affect payments on the Notes.\nHistorically, the market value of any component stock of the SPX was calculated as the product of the market price per share and the number of then outstanding shares of such component stock. In March 2005, SPDJI began shifting the SPX halfway from a market capitalization weighted formula to a float-adjusted formula, before moving the SPX to full float adjustment on September 16, 2005. SPDJI\u2019s criteria for selecting stocks for the SPX did not change with the shift to float adjustment. However, the adjustment affects each company\u2019s weight in the SPX.\nUnder float adjustment, the share counts used in calculating the SPX reflect only those shares that are available to investors, not all of a company\u2019s outstanding shares. Float adjustment excludes shares that are closely held by control groups, other publicly traded companies or government agencies.\nIn September 2012, all shareholdings representing more than 5% of a stock\u2019s outstanding shares, other than holdings by \u201cblock owners,\u201d were removed from the float for purposes of calculating the SPX. Generally, these \u201ccontrol holders\u201d will include officers and directors, private equity, venture capital and special equity firms, other publicly traded companies that hold shares for control, strategic partners, holders of restricted shares, ESOPs, employee and family trusts, foundations associated with the company, holders of unlisted share classes of stock, government entities at all levels (other than government retirement/pension funds) and any individual person who controls a 5% or greater stake in a company as reported in regulatory filings. However, holdings by block owners, such as depositary banks, pension funds, mutual funds and ETF providers, 401(k) plans of the company, government retirement/pension funds, investment funds of insurance companies, asset managers and investment funds, independent foundations and savings and investment plans, will ordinarily be considered part of the float.\nTreasury stock, stock options, restricted shares, equity participation units, warrants, preferred stock, convertible stock, and rights are not part of the float. Shares held in a trust to allow investors in countries outside the country of domicile, such as depositary shares and Canadian exchangeable shares, are normally part of the float unless those shares form a control block. If a company has multiple classes of stock outstanding, shares in an unlisted or non-traded class are treated as a control block.\nFor each stock, an investable weight factor (\u201cIWF\u201d) is calculated by dividing the available float shares by the total shares outstanding. Available float shares are defined as the total shares outstanding less shares held by control holders. This calculation is subject to a 5% minimum threshold for control blocks. For example, if a company\u2019s officers and directors hold 3% of the company\u2019s shares, and no other control group holds 5% of the company\u2019s shares, SPDJI would assign that company an IWF of 1.00, as no control group meets the 5% threshold. However, if a company\u2019s officers and directors hold 3% of the company\u2019s shares and another control group holds 20% of the company\u2019s shares, SPDJI would assign an IWF of 0.77, reflecting the fact that 23% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares are considered to be held for control. As of July 31, 2017, companies with multiple share class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the SPX. Constituents of the SPX prior to July 31, 2017 with multiple share class lines will be grandfathered in and continue to be included in the SPX. If a constituent company of the SPX reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure, that company will remain in the SPX at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee in order to minimize turnover.\nThe SPX is calculated using a base-weighted aggregate methodology. The level of the SPX reflects the total market value of all component stocks relative to the base period of the years 1941 through 1943. An indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order to make the level easier to work with and track over time. The actual total market value of the component stocks during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943 has been set to an indexed level of 10. This is often indicated by the notation 1941- 43 = 10. In practice, the daily calculation of the SPX is computed by dividing the total market value of the component stocks by the \u201cindex divisor.\u201d By itself, the index divisor is an arbitrary number. However, in the context of the calculation of the SPX, it serves as a link to the original base period level of the SPX. The index divisor keeps the SPX comparable over time and is the manipulation point for all adjustments to the SPX, which is index maintenance.\n_Index Maintenance_\nIndex maintenance includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to company restructuring or spinoffs. Some corporate actions, such as stock splits and stock dividends, require changes in the common shares outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the SPX, and do not require index divisor adjustments.\nTo prevent the level of the SPX from changing due to corporate actions, corporate actions which affect the total market value of the SPX require an index divisor adjustment. By adjusting the index divisor for the change in market value, the level of the SPX remains constant and does not reflect the corporate actions of individual companies in the SPX. Index divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the SPX closing level.\nChanges in a company\u2019s shares outstanding of 5.00% or more due to mergers, acquisitions, public offerings, tender offers, Dutch auctions, or exchange\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-18 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \noffers are made as soon as reasonably possible. Share changes due to mergers or acquisitions of publicly held companies that trade on a major exchange are implemented when the transaction occurs, even if both of the companies are not in the same headline index, and regardless of the size of the change. All other changes of 5.00% or more (due to, for example, company stock repurchases, private placements, redemptions, exercise of options, warrants, conversion of preferred stock, notes, debt, equity participation units, at-the-market offerings, or other recapitalizations) are made weekly and are announced on Fridays for implementation after the close of trading on the following Friday. Changes of less than 5.00% are accumulated and made quarterly on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, and are usually announced two to five days prior.\nIf a change in a company\u2019s shares outstanding of 5.00% or more causes a company\u2019s IWF to change by five percentage points or more, the IWF is updated at the same time as the share change. IWF changes resulting from partial tender offers are considered on a case by case basis.\n**Historical Performance of the XLE**\nThe following graph sets forth the daily historical performance of the XLE in the period from January 2, 2020 through October 16, 2025. We obtained this historical data from Bloomberg L.P. We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information obtained from Bloomberg L.P. On October 16, 2025, the Closing Market Price of the XLE was $85.28.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_009.jpg)\nThis historical data on the XLE is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of the XLE or what the value of the Notes may be. Any historical upward or downward trend in the Closing Market Price of the XLE during any period set forth above is not an indication that the Closing Market Price of the XLE is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time over the term of the Notes.\nBefore investing in the Notes, you should consult publicly available sources for the Closing Market Prices and trading pattern of the XLE.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-19 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \n**The Health Care Select Sector SPDR****\u00ae****Fund**\nThe shares of the XLV are issued by Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Trust, a registered investment company. The XLV seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Health Care Select Sector Index, its underlying index. The Health Care Select Sector Index measures the performance of the health care sector of the U.S. equity market. The XLV is composed of equity securities of companies in the pharmaceuticals, health care equipment and supplies, health care providers and services, biotechnology, life sciences tools and services and healthcare technology sectors. The XLV trades on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol \u201cXLV.\u201d\nThe shares of the XLV are registered under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, information filed with the SEC relating to the XLV, including its periodic financial reports, may be found on the SEC website.\n**_Investment Approach_**\nThe XLV utilizes a \u201cpassive\u201d or \u201cindexing\u201d investment approach in attempting to track the performance of the Health Care Select Sector Index. The XLV will invest in substantially all of the securities which comprise the Health Care Select Sector Index. The XLV will normally invest at least 95% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Health Care Select Sector Index.\n**_Investment Objective and Strategy_**\nThe XLV seeks to provide investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Health Care Select Sector Index. The investment manager of the XLV uses a replication strategy to try to achieve the XLV\u2019s investment objective, which means that the XLV generally invests in substantially all of the securities represented in the Health Care Select Sector Index in approximately the same proportions as the Health Care Select Sector Index. Under normal market conditions, the XLV generally invests at least 95% of its total assets in the securities comprising the Health Care Select Sector Index. In certain situations or market conditions, the XLV may temporarily depart from its normal investment policies and strategies provided that the alternative is consistent with the XLV\u2019s investment objective and is in the best interest of the XLV. For example, if the XLV is unable to invest directly in a component security or if a derivative investment may provide higher liquidity than other types of investments, it may make larger than normal investments in derivatives to maintain exposure to the Health Care Select Sector Index that it tracks. Consequently, under such circumstances, the XLV may invest in a different mix of investments than it would under normal circumstances. The XLV will provide shareholders with at least 60 days\u2019 notice prior to any material change in its investment policies. The XLV is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities. This differs from an actively managed underlying, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index.\nNotwithstanding the XLV\u2019s investment objective, the return on your Notes will not reflect any dividends paid on shares of the XLV, on the securities purchased by the XLV or on the securities that comprise the Health Care Select Sector Index.\n**_The Select Sector Indices_**\nThe underlying index of the XLV is part of the Select Sector Indices. The Select Sector Indices are sub-indices of the S&P 500\u00ae Index (\u201cSPX\u201d). Each stock in the SPX is allocated to at least one Select Sector Index, and the combined companies of the eleven Select Sector Indices represent all of the companies in the SPX. The industry indices are sub-categories within each Select Sector Index and represent a specific industry segment of the overall Select Sector Index. The eleven Select Sector Indices seek to represent the eleven SPX sectors. The index compilation agent for these indices (the \u201cIndex Compilation Agent\u201d) determines the composition of the Select Sector Indices based on S&P\u2019s sector classification methodology. Sector designations are determined by the index sponsor using criteria it has selected or developed. Index sponsors may use very different standards for determining sector designations. In addition, many companies operate in a number of sectors, but are listed in only one sector and the basis on which that sector is selected may also differ. As a result, sector comparisons between indices with different index sponsors may reflect differences in methodology as well as actual differences in the sector composition of the indices.\nEach Select Sector Index was developed and is maintained in accordance with the following criteria:\n\u2022 |  Each of the component stocks in a Select Sector Index (the \u201cComponent Stocks\u201d) is a constituent company of the SPX.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  The eleven Select Sector Indices together will include all of the companies represented in the SPX and each of the stocks in the SPX will be allocated to at least one of the Select Sector Indices.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  The Index Compilation Agent assigns each constituent stock of the SPX to a Select Sector Index. The Index Compilation Agent assigns a company\u2019s stock to a particular Select Sector Index based on S&P Dow Jones Indices\u2019s sector classification methodology as set forth in its Global Industry Classification Standard.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  Each Select Sector Index is calculated by S&P Dow Jones Indices using a modified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d methodology. This design ensures that each of the component stocks within a Select Sector Index is represented in a proportion consistent with its percentage with respect to the total market capitalization of that Select Sector Index.  \n---|---  \nFor reweighting purposes, each Select Sector Index is rebalanced quarterly after the close of business on the second to last calculation day of March, June, September and December using the following procedures: (1) The rebalancing reference date is two business days prior to the last calculation day of each quarter; and (2) With prices reflected on the rebalancing reference date, and membership, shares outstanding, additional weight factor (capping factor) and investable weight factors (as described in the section \u201cComputation of the S&P 500 Index\u00ae\u201d below) as of the rebalancing effective date, each\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017615/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME (WITH MEMORY FEATURE) ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-20 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income (with Memory Feature) Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Energy Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR\u00ae Fund and the SPDR\u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF   \n---  \ncompany is weighted using the modified market capitalization methodology. Modifications are made as defined below.\n(i) |  The indices are first evaluated to ensure none of the indices breach the maximum allowable limits defined in rules (ii) and (v) below. If any of the allowable limits are breached, the component stocks are reweighted based on their float-adjusted market capitalization weights.  \n---|---  \n(i) |  If any component stock has a weight greater than 24%, that component stock has its float-adjusted market capitalization weight capped at 23%. The 23% weight cap creates a 2% buffer to ensure that no component stock exceeds 25% as of the quarter-end diversification requirement date.  \n---|---  \n(ii) |  All excess weight is equally redistributed to all uncapped component stocks within the relevant Select Sector Index.  \n---|---  \n(iii) |  After this redistribution, if the float-adjusted market capitalization weight of any other component stock(s) then breaches 23%, the process is repeated iteratively until no component stock breaches the 23% weight cap.  \n---|---  \n(iv) |  The sum of the component stocks with weight greater than 4.8% cannot exceed 50% of the total index weight. These caps are set to allow for a buffer below the 5% limit.  \n---|---  \n(v) |  If the rule in step (v) is breached, all the component stocks are ranked in descending order of their float-adjusted market capitalization weights and the first component stock that causes the 50% limit to be breached has its weight reduced to 4.6%.  \n---|---  \n(vi) |  This excess weight is equally redistributed to all component stocks with weights below 4.6%. This process is repeated iteratively until step (v) is satisfied.  \n---|---  \n(vii) |  Index share amounts are assigned to each component stock to arrive at the weights calculated above. Since index shares are assigned based on prices one business day prior to rebalancing, the actual weight of each component stock at the rebalancing differs somewhat from these weights due to market movements.  \n---|---  \n(viii) |  If necessary, the reweighting process may take place more than once prior to the close on the last business day of March, June, September or December to ensure conformity with all diversification requirements.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  Each Select Sector Index is calculated using the same methodology utilized by S&P Dow Jones Indices in calculating the SPX, using a base-weighted aggregate methodology.

In the event that the Index Compilation Agent notifies S&P Dow Jones Indices that a Component Stock\u2019s Select Sector Index assignment should be changed, S&P Dow Jones Indices will disseminate notice of the change following its standard procedure for announcing index changes and will implement the change in the affected Select Sector Indices on a date no less than one week after the initial dissemination of information on the sector change to the maximum extent practicable.

The economic terms of the Notes are based on BAC\u2019s internal funding rate, which is the rate it would pay to borrow funds through the issuance of market-linked notes, and the economic terms of certain related hedging arrangements BAC\u2019s affiliates enter into. BAC\u2019s internal funding rate is typically lower than the rate it would pay when it issues conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities. This difference in funding rate, as well as the underwriting discount, if any, and the hedging related charges described below (see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page PS-9), will reduce the economic terms of the Notes to you and the initial estimated value of the Notes. Due to these factors, the public offering price you pay to purchase the Notes will be greater than the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the pricing date.\nThe initial estimated value range of the Notes is set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. The final pricing supplement will set forth the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the pricing date. For more information about the initial estimated value and the structuring of the Notes, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page PS-9 and \u201cStructuring the Notes\u201d on page PS-24.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-5 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500\u00ae Index   \n---  \nContingent Coupon Payment and Redemption Amount Determination\n**On each Contingent Payment Date, if the Notes have not been previously called, you may receive a**\n**Contingent Coupon Payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes determined as follows:**\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_gt1.jpg)\n**Assuming the Notes have not been called,****on the Maturity Date, you will receive a cash payment per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes determined as follows:**\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_gt2.jpg)\nAll payments described above are subject to the credit risk of BofA Finance, as Issuer, and BAC, as Guarantor.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-6 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500\u00ae Index   \n---  \nTotal Contingent Coupon Payment Examples\nThe table below illustrates the hypothetical total Contingent Coupon Payments per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes over the term of the Notes, based on the Contingent Coupon Payment of $9.667, depending on how many Contingent Coupon Payments are payable prior to an Optional Early Redemption or maturity.

Your decision to purchase the Notes should be made only after carefully considering the risks of an investment in the Notes, including those discussed below, with your advisors in light of your particular circumstances. The Notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about significant elements of the Notes or financial matters in general. You should carefully review the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections beginning on page PS-5 of the accompanying product supplement, page S-6 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and page 7 of the accompanying prospectus, each as identified on page PS-__28_ _below._\n**_Structure-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **Your investment may result in a loss; there is no guaranteed return of principal.** There is no fixed principal repayment amount on the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not called prior to maturity and the Ending Value of **any** Underlying is less than its Threshold Value, at maturity, your investment will be subject to 1:1 downside exposure to decreases in the value of the Least Performing Underlying and you will lose 1% of the principal amount for each 1% that the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Starting Value. In that case, you will lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Your return on the Notes is limited to the return represented by the Contingent Coupon Payments, if any, over the term of the Notes.** Your return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupon Payments paid over the term of the Notes, regardless of the extent to which the Observation Value or Ending Value of any Underlying exceeds its Coupon Barrier or Starting Value, as applicable. Similarly, the amount payable at maturity or upon an Optional Early Redemption will never exceed the sum of the principal amount and the applicable Contingent Coupon Payment, regardless of the extent to which the Observation Value or Ending Value of any Underlying exceeds its Starting Value. In contrast, a direct investment in the securities included in one or more of the Underlyings would allow you to receive the benefit of any appreciation in their values. Any return on the Notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned those securities and received the dividends paid or distributions made on them.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The Notes are subject to Optional Early Redemption, which would limit your ability to receive the Contingent Coupon Payments over the full term of the Notes.** On each Call Payment Date, at our option, we may call your Notes in whole, but not in part. If the Notes are called prior to the Maturity Date, you will be entitled to receive the Early Redemption Amount on the applicable Call Payment Date, and no further amounts will be payable on the Notes. In this case, you will lose the opportunity to continue to receive Contingent Coupon Payments after the date of the Optional Early Redemption. If the Notes are called prior to the Maturity Date, you may be unable to invest in other securities with a similar level of risk that could provide a return that is similar to the Notes. Even if we do not exercise our option to call your Notes, our ability to do so may adversely affect the market value of your Notes. It is our sole option whether to call your Notes prior to maturity on any such Call Payment Date and we may or may not exercise this option for any reason. Because of this Optional Early Redemption potential, the term of your Notes could be anywhere between three and eighteen months.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **You may not receive any Contingent Coupon Payments.** The Notes do not provide for any regular fixed coupon payments. Investors in the Notes will not necessarily receive any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes. If the Observation Value of any Underlying is less than its Coupon Barrier on an Observation Date, you will not receive the Contingent Coupon Payment applicable to that Observation Date. If the Observation Value of any Underlying is less than its Coupon Barrier on all the Observation Dates during the term of the Notes, you will not receive any Contingent Coupon Payments during the term of the Notes, and will not receive a positive return on the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Your return on the Notes may be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.** Any return that you receive on the Notes may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased a conventional debt security with the same Maturity Date. As a result, your investment in the Notes may not reflect the full opportunity cost to you when you consider factors, such as inflation, that affect the time value of money. In addition, if interest rates increase during the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon Payment (if any) may be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The Contingent Coupon Payment, Early Redemption Amount or Redemption Amount, as applicable, will not reflect changes in the levels of the Underlyings other than on the Observation Dates.** The levels of the Underlyings during the term of the Notes other than on the Observation Dates will not affect payments on the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, investors should generally be aware of the performance of the Underlyings while holding the Notes, as the performance of the Underlyings may influence the market value of the Notes. The calculation agent will determine whether each Contingent Coupon Payment is payable and will calculate the Early Redemption Amount or the Redemption Amount, as applicable, by comparing only the Starting Value, the Coupon Barrier or the Threshold Value, as applicable, to the Observation Value or the Ending Value for each Underlying. No other levels of the Underlyings will be taken into account. As a result, if the Notes are not called prior to maturity and the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Threshold Value, you will receive less than the principal amount at maturity even if the level of each Underlying was always above its Threshold Value prior to the Valuation Date.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Because the Notes are linked to the least performing (and not the average performance) of the Underlyings, you may not receive any return on the Notes and may lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes even if the Observation Value or Ending Value of one Underlying is greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier or Threshold Value, as applicable.** Your Notes are linked to the least performing of the Underlyings, and a change in the level of one Underlying may not correlate with changes in the levels of the other Underlyings. The Notes are not linked to a basket composed of the Underlyings, where the depreciation in the level  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-9 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500\u00ae Index   \n---  \n|  of one Underlying could be offset to some extent by the appreciation in the levels of the other Underlyings. In the case of the Notes, the individual performance of each Underlying would not be combined, and the depreciation in the level of one Underlying would not be offset by any appreciation in the levels of the other Underlyings. Even if the Observation Value of an Underlying is at or above its Coupon Barrier on an Observation Date, you will not receive the Contingent Coupon Payment with respect to that Observation Date if the Observation Value of another Underlying is below its Coupon Barrier on that day. In addition, even if the Ending Value of an Underlying is at or above its Threshold Value, you will lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes if the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is below its Threshold Value.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **Any payments on the Notes are subject to our credit risk and the credit risk of the Guarantor, and any actual or perceived changes in our or the Guarantor\u2019s creditworthiness are expected to affect the value of the Notes.** The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. Any payment on the Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor. The Notes are not guaranteed by any entity other than the Guarantor. As a result, your receipt of any payments on the Notes will be dependent upon our ability and the ability of the Guarantor to repay our respective obligations under the Notes on the applicable payment date, regardless of the performance of the Underlyings. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition or the financial condition of the Guarantor will be at any time after the pricing date of the Notes. If we and the Guarantor become unable to meet our respective financial obligations as they become due, you may not receive the amount(s) payable under the terms of the Notes.   \n  \nIn addition, our credit ratings and the credit ratings of the Guarantor are assessments by ratings agencies of our respective abilities to pay our obligations. Consequently, our or the Guarantor\u2019s perceived creditworthiness and actual or anticipated decreases in our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit ratings or increases in the spread between the yield on our respective securities and the yield on U.S. Treasury securities (the \u201ccredit spread\u201d) prior to the Maturity Date may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. However, because your return on the Notes depends upon factors in addition to our ability and the ability of the Guarantor to pay our respective obligations, such as the values of the Underlyings, an improvement in our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit ratings will not reduce the other investment risks related to the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **We are a finance subsidiary and, as such, have no independent assets, operations, or revenues.** We are a finance subsidiary of the Guarantor, have no operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of our debt securities that are guaranteed by the Guarantor, and are dependent upon the Guarantor and/or its other subsidiaries to meet our obligations under the Notes in the ordinary course. Therefore, our ability to make payments on the Notes may be limited.  \n---|---  \n**_Valuation and Market-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **The public offering price you pay for the Notes will exceed their initial estimated value.** The range of initial estimated values of the Notes that is provided on the cover page of this preliminary pricing supplement, and the initial estimated value as of the pricing date that will be provided in the final pricing supplement, are each estimates only, determined as of a particular point in time by reference to our and our affiliates\u2019 pricing models. These pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables, including our credit spreads and those of the Guarantor, the Guarantor\u2019s internal funding rate, mid-market terms on hedging transactions, expectations on interest rates, dividends and volatility, price-sensitivity analysis, and the expected term of the Notes. These pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity, their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and lower than their initial estimated value. This is due to, among other things, changes in the levels of the Underlyings, changes in the Guarantor\u2019s internal funding rate, and the inclusion in the public offering price of the underwriting discount, if any, and the hedging related charges, all as further described in \u201cStructuring the Notes\u201d below. These factors, together with various credit, market and economic factors over the term of the Notes, are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The initial estimated value does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which we, BAC, BofAS or any of our other affiliates would be willing to purchase your Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time.** The value of your Notes at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy, including the performance of the Underlyings, our and BAC\u2019s creditworthiness and changes in market conditions.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **We cannot assure you that a trading market for your Notes will ever develop or be maintained.** We will not list the Notes on any securities exchange. We cannot predict how the Notes will trade in any secondary market or whether that market will be liquid or illiquid.  \n---|---  \n**_Conflict-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **Trading and hedging activities by us, the Guarantor and any of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may create conflicts of interest with you and may affect your return on the Notes and their market value.** We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may buy or sell the securities held by or included in the Underlyings, or futures or options contracts or exchange traded instruments on the Underlyings or those securities, or other instruments whose value is derived from the Underlyings or those securities . While we, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may from time to time own securities represented by the Underlyings, except to the extent that BAC\u2019s common stock may be included in the Underlyings, we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, do not control any company included in the Underlyings, and have not verified any disclosure made by any other company. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may execute such purchases or sales for our own or their own accounts, for business reasons, or in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes.

These transactions may adversely affect the levels of the Underlyings in a manner that could be adverse to your investment in the Notes. On or before the Strike Date, any purchases or sales by us, the Guarantor or our other affiliates, including BofAS or others on our or their behalf (including those for the purpose of hedging some or all of our anticipated exposure in connection with the Notes), may have affected the levels of the Underlyings. Consequently, the levels of the Underlyings may change subsequent to the Strike Date, which may adversely affect the market value of the Notes.   \n  \nWe, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, also may have engaged in hedging activities that could have affected the levels of the Underlyings on the Strike Date. In addition, these hedging activities, including the unwinding of a hedge, may decrease the market value of your Notes prior to maturity, and may affect the amounts to be paid on the Notes. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may purchase or otherwise acquire a long or short position in the Notes and may hold or resell the Notes. For example, BofAS may enter into these transactions in connection with any market making activities in which it engages. We cannot assure you that these activities will not adversely affect the levels of the Underlyings, the market value of your Notes prior to maturity or the amounts payable on the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **There may be potential conflicts of interest involving the calculation agent, which is an affiliate of ours.** We have the right to appoint and remove the calculation agent. One of our affiliates will be the calculation agent for the Notes and, as such, will make a variety of determinations relating to the Notes, including the amounts that will be paid on the Notes. Under some circumstances, these duties could result in a conflict of interest between its status as our affiliate and its responsibilities as calculation agent.  \n---|---  \n**_Underlying-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **The Notes are subject to risks associated with small-size capitalization companies.** The stocks comprising the RTY are issued by companies with small-sized market capitalization. The stock prices of small-size companies may be more volatile than stock prices of large capitalization companies. Small-size capitalization companies may be less able to withstand adverse economic, market, trade and competitive conditions relative to larger companies. Small-size capitalization companies may also be more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products or services.  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  **The Notes are subject to risks associated with foreign securities markets.** The NDX includes certain foreign equity securities. You should be aware that investments in securities linked to the value of foreign equity securities involve particular risks. The foreign securities markets comprising the NDX may have less liquidity and may be more volatile than U.S. or other securities markets and market developments may affect foreign markets differently from U.S. or other securities markets. Direct or indirect government intervention to stabilize these foreign securities markets, as well as cross-shareholdings in foreign companies, may affect trading prices and volumes in these markets. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies than about those U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and foreign companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements that differ from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies.  \n---|---  \nPrices of securities in foreign countries are subject to political, economic, financial and social factors that apply in those geographical regions. These factors, which could negatively affect those securities markets, include the possibility of recent or future changes in a foreign government\u2019s economic and fiscal policies, the possible imposition of, or changes in, currency exchange laws or other laws or restrictions applicable to foreign companies or investments in foreign equity securities and the possibility of fluctuations in the rate of exchange between currencies, the possibility of outbreaks of hostility and political instability and the possibility of natural disaster or adverse public health developments in the region. Moreover, foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in important respects such as growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resources and self-sufficiency.\n\u2022 |  **The publisher or the sponsor of an Underlying may adjust that Underlying in a way that affects its levels, and the publisher or the sponsor has no obligation to consider your interests.** The publisher or the sponsor of an Underlying can add, delete, or substitute the components included in that Underlying or make other methodological changes that could change its level. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of your Notes.  \n---|---  \n**_Tax-related Risks_**\n\u2022 |  **The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, and may be adverse to a holder of the Notes.** No statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the Notes or securities similar to the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are not certain. Under the terms of the Notes, you will have agreed with us to treat the Notes as contingent income-bearing single financial contracts, as described below under \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Summary\u2014General.\u201d If the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) were successful in asserting an alternative characterization for the Notes, the timing and character of income, gain or loss with respect to the Notes may differ. No ruling will be requested from the IRS with respect to the Notes and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the statements made in the section entitled \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Summary.\u201d **You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of investing in the Notes.**  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-11 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500\u00ae Index   \n---  \nThe Underlyings\nAll disclosures contained in this pricing supplement regarding the Underlyings, including, without limitation, their make-up, method of calculation, and changes in their components, have been derived from publicly available sources.

None of us, the Guarantor, BofAS or any of our other affiliates makes any representation to you as to the future performance of the Underlyings. You should make your own investigation into the Underlyings.\n**The Nasdaq-100****\u00ae****Index**\nThe NDX is intended to measure the performance of the 100 largest domestic and international non-financial securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market (\"NASDAQ\") based on market capitalization. The NDX reflects companies across major industry groups including computer hardware and software, telecommunications, retail/wholesale trade and biotechnology. It does not contain securities of financial companies including investment companies.\nThe NDX began trading on January 31, 1985 at a base value of 125.00. The NDX is calculated and published by Nasdaq, Inc. In administering the NDX, Nasdaq, Inc. will exercise reasonable discretion as it deems appropriate.\n**_Underlying Stock Eligibility Criteria_**\nNDX eligibility is limited to specific security types only. The security types eligible for the NDX include foreign or domestic common stocks, ordinary shares, ADRs and tracking stocks. Security types not included in the NDX are closed-end funds, convertible debt securities, exchange traded funds, limited liability companies, limited partnership interests, preferred stocks, rights, shares or units of beneficial interest, warrants, units, and other derivative securities. The NDX does not contain securities of investment companies. For purposes of the NDX eligibility criteria, if the security is a depositary receipt representing a security of a non-U.S. issuer, then references to the \u201cissuer\u201d are references to the issuer of the underlying security.\n_Initial Eligibility Criteria_\nTo be eligible for initial inclusion in the NDX, a security must be listed on NASDAQ and meet the following criteria:\n\u2022 |  the security\u2019s U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market (unless the security was dually listed on another U.S. market prior to January 1, 2004 and has continuously maintained such listing);  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security must be of a non-financial company;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy proceedings;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security must have a minimum three-month average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  if the issuer of the security is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the U.S., then such security must have listed options on a recognized options market in the U.S. or be eligible for listed-options trading on a recognized options market in the U.S.;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the issuer of the security may not have entered into a definitive agreement or other arrangement which would likely result in the security no longer being eligible for inclusion in the NDX;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements with an audit opinion that is currently withdrawn; and  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the issuer of the security must have \u201cseasoned\u201d on NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange or NYSE Amex. Generally, a company is considered to be seasoned if it has been listed on a market for at least three full months (excluding the first month of initial listing).  \n---|---  \n_Continued Eligibility Criteria_\nIn addition, to be eligible for continued inclusion in the NDX, the following criteria apply:\n\u2022 |  the security\u2019s U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security must be of a non-financial company;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy proceedings;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security must have a minimum three-month average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares;  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  if the issuer of the security is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the U.S., then such security must have listed options on a recognized options market in the U.S. or be eligible for listed-options trading on a recognized options market in the U.S. (measured annually during the ranking review process);  \n---|---  \n\u2022 |  the security must have an adjusted market capitalization equal to or exceeding 0.10% of the aggregate adjusted market capitalization of the NDX at each month-end. In the event a company does not meet this criterion for two consecutive month-ends, it will be removed from the NDX effective after the close of trading on the third Friday of the following month; and  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-12 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500\u00ae Index   \n---  \n\u2022 |  the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements with an audit opinion that is currently withdrawn.  \n---|---  \n**_Computation of the NDX_**\nThe value of the NDX equals the aggregate value of the NDX share weights (the \u201cNDX Shares\u201d) of each of the NDX securities multiplied by each such security\u2019s last sale price (last sale price refers to the last sale price on NASDAQ), and divided by the divisor of the NDX. If trading in an NDX security is halted while the market is open, the last traded price for that security is used for all NDX computations until trading resumes. If trading is halted before the market is open, the previous day\u2019s last sale price is used. The formula for determining the NDX value is as follows:\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_009.jpg)\nThe NDX is ordinarily calculated without regard to cash dividends on NDX securities. The NDX is calculated during the trading day and is disseminated once per second from 09:30:01 to 17:16:00 ET. The closing level of the NDX may change up until 17:15:00 ET due to corrections to the last sale price of the NDX securities. The official closing value of the NDX is ordinarily disseminated at 17:16:00 ET.\n**_NDX Maintenance_**\n_Changes to NDX Constituents_\nChanges to the NDX constituents may be made during the annual ranking review. In addition, if at any time during the year other than the annual review, it is determined that an NDX security issuer no longer meets the criteria for continued inclusion in the NDX, or is otherwise determined to have become ineligible for continued inclusion in the NDX, it is replaced with the largest market capitalization issuer not currently in the NDX that meets the applicable eligibility criteria for initial inclusion in the NDX.\nOrdinarily, a security will be removed from the NDX at its last sale price. However, if at the time of its removal the NDX security is halted from trading on its primary listing market and an official closing price cannot readily be determined, the NDX security may, in Nasdaq, Inc.\u2019s discretion, be removed at a price of $0.00000001 (\u201czero price\u201d). This zero price will be applied to the NDX security after the close of the market but prior to the time the official closing value of the NDX is disseminated.\n_Divisor Adjustments_\nThe divisor is adjusted to ensure that changes in the NDX constituents either by corporate actions (that adjust either the price or shares of an NDX security) or NDX participation outside of trading hours do not affect the value of the NDX. All divisor changes occur after the close of the applicable index security markets.\n_Quarterly NDX Rebalancing_\nThe NDX will be rebalanced on a quarterly basis if it is determined that (1) the current weight of the single NDX security with the largest market capitalization is greater than 24.0% of the NDX or (2) the collective weight of those securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5% exceeds 48.0% of the NDX. In addition, a \u201cspecial rebalancing\u201d of the NDX may be conducted at any time if Nasdaq, Inc. determines it necessary to maintain the integrity and continuity of the NDX. If either one or both of the above weight distribution conditions are met upon quarterly review, or Nasdaq, Inc. determines that a special rebalancing is necessary, a weight rebalancing will be performed.\nIf the first weight distribution condition is met and the current weight of the single NDX security with the largest market capitalization is greater than 24.0%, then the weights of all securities with current weights greater than 1.0% (\u201clarge securities\u201d) will be scaled down proportionately toward 1.0% until the adjusted weight of the single largest NDX security reaches 20.0%.\nIf the second weight distribution condition is met and the collective weight of those securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5% (or adjusted weights in accordance with the previous step, if applicable) exceeds 48.0% of the NDX, then the weights of all such large securities in that group will be scaled down proportionately toward 1.0% until their collective weight, so adjusted, is equal to 40.0%.\nThe aggregate weight reduction among the large securities resulting from either or both of the rebalancing steps above will then be redistributed to those securities with weightings of less than 1.0% (\u201csmall securities\u201d) in the following manner. In the first iteration, the weight of the largest small security will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal to the average NDX weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller remaining small securities will be scaled up by the same factor reduced in relation to each security\u2019s relative ranking among the small securities such that the smaller the NDX security in the ranking, the less its weight will be scaled upward. This is intended to reduce the market impact of the weight rebalancing on the smallest component securities in the NDX.\nIn the second iteration of the small security rebalancing, the weight of the second largest small security, already adjusted in the first iteration, will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal to the average NDX weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller remaining small securities will be scaled up by this same factor reduced in relation to each security\u2019s relative ranking among the small securities such that, once again, the smaller the security in the ranking, the less its weight will be scaled upward. Additional iterations will be performed until the accumulated increase in weight among\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-13 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500\u00ae Index   \n---  \nthe small securities equals the aggregate weight reduction among the large securities that resulted from the rebalancing in accordance with the two weight distribution conditions discussed above.\nFinally, to complete the rebalancing process, once the final weighting percentages for each NDX security have been set, the NDX Shares will be determined anew based upon the last sale prices and aggregate capitalization of the NDX at the close of trading on the last calendar day in February, May, August and November. Changes to the NDX Shares will be made effective after the close of trading on the third Friday in March, June, September and December, and an adjustment to the divisor is made to ensure continuity of the NDX. Ordinarily, new rebalanced NDX Shares will be determined by applying the above procedures to the current NDX Shares. However, Nasdaq, Inc. may, from time to time, determine rebalanced weights, if necessary, by applying the above procedure to the actual current market capitalization of the NDX components. In such instances, Nasdaq, Inc. would announce the different basis for rebalancing prior to its implementation.\nDuring the quarterly rebalancing, data is cutoff as of the previous month end and no changes are made to the NDX from that cutoff until the quarterly index share change effective date, except in the case of changes due to corporate actions with an ex-date.\n**_Adjustments for Corporate Actions_**\nChanges in the price and/or NDX Shares driven by corporate events such as stock dividends, splits, and certain spin-offs and rights issuances will be adjusted on the ex-date. If the change in total shares outstanding arising from other corporate actions is greater than or equal to 10.0%, the change will be made as soon as practicable. Otherwise, if the change in total shares outstanding is less than 10.0%, then all such changes are accumulated and made effective at one time on a quarterly basis after the close of trading on the third Friday in each of March, June, September, and December. The NDX Shares are derived from the security\u2019s total shares outstanding. The NDX Shares are adjusted by the same percentage amount by which the total shares outstanding have changed.\n**Historical Performance of the NDX**\nThe following graph sets forth the daily historical performance of the NDX in the period from January 2, 2020 through the Strike Date. We obtained this historical data from Bloomberg L.P. We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information obtained from Bloomberg L.P. On the Strike Date, the closing level of the NDX was 24,657.24.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_0010.jpg)\nThis historical data on the NDX is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of the NDX or what the value of the Notes may be. Any historical upward or downward trend in the closing level of the NDX during any period set forth above is not an indication that the closing level of the NDX is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time over the term of the Notes.\nBefore investing in the Notes, you should consult publicly available sources for the closing levels of the NDX.\n**_License Agreement_**\nThe Notes are not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Nasdaq, Inc. or its affiliates (Nasdaq, Inc., with its affiliates, are referred to as the \u201cCorporations\u201d).

Additional information on the RTY is available at the following website: http://www.ftserussell.com. No information on that website is deemed to be included or incorporated by reference in this pricing supplement.\nRussell began dissemination of the RTY on January 1, 1984. FTSE Russell calculates and publishes the RTY. The RTY was set to 135 as of the close of business on December 31, 1986. The RTY is designed to track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. As a subset of the Russell 3000\u00ae Index, the RTY consists of the smallest 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000\u00ae Index. The Russell 3000\u00ae Index measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies, representing approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market. The RTY is determined, comprised, and calculated by FTSE Russell without regard to the Notes.\n**_Selection of Stocks Comprising the RTY_**\nEach company eligible for inclusion in the RTY must be classified as a U.S. company under FTSE Russell\u2019s country-assignment methodology. If a company is incorporated, has a stated headquarters location, and trades in the same country (American Depositary Receipts and American Depositary Shares are not eligible), then the company is assigned to its country of incorporation. If any of the three factors are not the same, FTSE Russell defines three Home Country Indicators (\u201cHCIs\u201d): country of incorporation, country of headquarters, and country of the most liquid exchange (as defined by a two-year average daily dollar trading volume) from all exchanges within a country. Using the HCIs, FTSE Russell compares the primary location of the company\u2019s assets with the three HCIs. If the primary location of its assets matches any of the HCIs, then the company is assigned to the primary location of its assets. If there is insufficient information to determine the country in which the company\u2019s assets are primarily located, FTSE Russell will use the country from which the company\u2019s revenues are primarily derived for the comparison with the three HCIs in a similar manner. FTSE Russell uses the average of two years of assets or revenues data to reduce potential turnover. If conclusive country details cannot be derived from assets or revenues data, FTSE Russell will assign the company to the country of its headquarters, which is defined as the address of the company\u2019s principal executive offices, unless that country is a Benefit Driven Incorporation (\u201cBDI\u201d) country, in which case the company will be assigned to the country of its most liquid stock exchange. BDI countries include: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Bonaire, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cook Islands, Curacao, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Liberia, Marshall Islands, Panama, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Turks and Caicos Islands. For any companies incorporated or headquartered in a U.S. territory, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. HCI is assigned.\nAll securities eligible for inclusion in the RTY must trade on a major U.S. exchange. Stocks must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on their primary exchange on the last trading day in May to be eligible for inclusion during annual reconstitution. However, in order to reduce unnecessary turnover, if an existing member\u2019s closing price is less than $1.00 on the last day of May, it will be considered eligible if the average of the daily closing prices (from its primary exchange) during the month of May is equal to or greater than $1.00. Initial public offerings are added each quarter and must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on the last day of their eligibility period in order to qualify for index inclusion. If an existing stock does not trade on the \u201crank day\u201d (typically the last trading day in May but a confirmed timetable is announced each spring) but does have a closing price at or above $1.00 on another eligible U.S. exchange, that stock will be eligible for inclusion.\nAn important criterion used to determine the list of securities eligible for the RTY is total market capitalization, which is defined as the market price as of the last trading day in May for those securities being considered at annual reconstitution times the total number of shares outstanding. Where applicable, common stock, non-restricted exchangeable shares and partnership units/membership interests are used to determine market capitalization. Any other form of shares such as preferred stock, convertible preferred stock, redeemable shares, participating preferred stock, warrants and rights, installment receipts or trust receipts, are excluded from the calculation. If multiple share classes of common stock exist, they are combined. In cases where the common stock share classes act independently of each other (e.g., tracking stocks), each class is considered for inclusion separately. If multiple share classes exist, the pricing vehicle will be designated as the share class with the highest two-year trading volume as of the rank day in May.\nCompanies with a total market capitalization of less than $30 million are not eligible for the RTY. Similarly, companies with only 5% or less of their shares available in the marketplace are not eligible for the RTY. Royalty trusts, limited liability companies, closed-end investment companies (companies that are required to report Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, as defined by the SEC, including business development companies), blank check companies, special purpose acquisition companies, and limited partnerships are also ineligible for inclusion. Bulletin board, pink sheets, and over-the-counter traded securities are not eligible for inclusion. Exchange traded funds and mutual funds are also excluded.\nAnnual reconstitution is a process by which the RTY is completely rebuilt. Based on closing levels of the company\u2019s common stock on its primary exchange on the rank day of May of each year, FTSE Russell reconstitutes the composition of the RTY using the then existing market capitalizations of eligible companies. Reconstitution of the RTY occurs on the last Friday in June or, when the last Friday in June is the 29th or 30th, reconstitution occurs on the prior Friday. In addition, FTSE Russell adds initial public offerings to the RTY on a quarterly basis based on total market capitalization ranking within the market-adjusted capitalization breaks established during the most recent reconstitution. After membership is determined, a security\u2019s shares are adjusted to include only those shares available to the public. This is often referred to as \u201cfree float.\u201d The purpose of the adjustment is to exclude from market calculations the capitalization that is not available for purchase and is not part of the investable opportunity set.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-16 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500\u00ae Index   \n---  \n**Historical Performance of the RTY**\nThe following graph sets forth the daily historical performance of the RTY in the period from January 2, 2020 through the Strike Date.

The SPX is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of common stock price movement. The calculation of the level of the SPX is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of 500 companies as of a particular time compared to the aggregate average market value of the common stocks of 500 similar companies during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943.\nThe SPX includes companies from eleven main groups: Communication Services; Consumer Discretionary; Consumer Staples; Energy; Financials; Health Care; Industrials; Information Technology; Real Estate; Materials; and Utilities. S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (\u201cSPDJI\u201d), the sponsor of the SPX, may from time to time, in its sole discretion, add companies to, or delete companies from, the SPX to achieve the objectives stated above.\nSPDJI calculates the SPX by reference to the prices of the constituent stocks of the SPX without taking account of the value of dividends paid on those stocks. As a result, the return on the Notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the SPX constituent stocks and received the dividends paid on those stocks.\n_Computation of the SPX_\nWhile SPDJI currently employs the following methodology to calculate the SPX, no assurance can be given that SPDJI will not modify or change this methodology in a manner that may affect payments on the Notes.\nHistorically, the market value of any component stock of the SPX was calculated as the product of the market price per share and the number of then outstanding shares of such component stock. In March 2005, SPDJI began shifting the SPX halfway from a market capitalization weighted formula to a float-adjusted formula, before moving the SPX to full float adjustment on September 16, 2005. SPDJI\u2019s criteria for selecting stocks for the SPX did not change with the shift to float adjustment. However, the adjustment affects each company\u2019s weight in the SPX.\nUnder float adjustment, the share counts used in calculating the SPX reflect only those shares that are available to investors, not all of a company\u2019s outstanding shares. Float adjustment excludes shares that are closely held by control groups, other publicly traded companies or government agencies.\nIn September 2012, all shareholdings representing more than 5% of a stock\u2019s outstanding shares, other than holdings by \u201cblock owners,\u201d were removed from the float for purposes of calculating the SPX. Generally, these \u201ccontrol holders\u201d will include officers and directors, private equity, venture capital and special equity firms, other publicly traded companies that hold shares for control, strategic partners, holders of restricted shares, ESOPs, employee and family trusts, foundations associated with the company, holders of unlisted share classes of stock, government entities at all levels (other than government retirement/pension funds) and any individual person who controls a 5% or greater stake in a company as reported in regulatory filings. However, holdings by block owners, such as depositary banks, pension funds, mutual funds and ETF providers, 401(k) plans of the company, government retirement/pension funds, investment funds of insurance companies, asset managers and investment funds, independent foundations and savings and investment plans, will ordinarily be considered part of the float.\nTreasury stock, stock options, restricted shares, equity participation units, warrants, preferred stock, convertible stock, and rights are not part of the float. Shares held in a trust to allow investors in countries outside the country of domicile, such as depositary shares and Canadian exchangeable shares, are normally part of the float unless those shares form a control block. If a company has multiple classes of stock outstanding, shares in an unlisted or non-traded class are treated as a control block.\nFor each stock, an investable weight factor (\u201cIWF\u201d) is calculated by dividing the available float shares by the total shares outstanding. Available float shares are defined as the total shares outstanding less shares held by control holders. This calculation is subject to a 5% minimum threshold for control blocks. For example, if a company\u2019s officers and directors hold 3% of the company\u2019s shares, and no other control group holds 5% of the company\u2019s shares, SPDJI would assign that company an IWF of 1.00, as no control group meets the 5% threshold. However, if a company\u2019s officers and directors hold 3% of the company\u2019s shares and another control group holds 20% of the company\u2019s shares, SPDJI would assign an IWF of 0.77, reflecting the fact that 23% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares are considered to be held for control. As of July 31, 2017, companies with multiple share class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the SPX. Constituents of the SPX prior to July 31, 2017 with multiple share class lines will be grandfathered in and continue to be included in the SPX. If a constituent company of the SPX reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure, that company will remain in the SPX at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee in order to minimize turnover.\nThe SPX is calculated using a base-weighted aggregate methodology. The level of the SPX reflects the total market value of all component stocks relative to the base period of the years 1941 through 1943. An indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order to make the level easier to work with and track over time. The actual total market value of the component stocks during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943 has been set to an indexed level of 10. This is often indicated by the notation 1941- 43 = 10. In practice, the daily calculation of the SPX is computed by dividing the total market value of the component stocks by the \u201cindex divisor.\u201d By itself, the index divisor is an arbitrary number. However, in the context of the calculation of the SPX, it serves as a link to the original base period level of the SPX. The index divisor keeps the SPX comparable over time and is the manipulation point for all adjustments to the SPX, which is index maintenance.\n_Index Maintenance_\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-19 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500\u00ae Index   \n---  \nIndex maintenance includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to company restructuring or spinoffs. Some corporate actions, such as stock splits and stock dividends, require changes in the common shares outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the SPX, and do not require index divisor adjustments.\nTo prevent the level of the SPX from changing due to corporate actions, corporate actions which affect the total market value of the SPX require an index divisor adjustment. By adjusting the index divisor for the change in market value, the level of the SPX remains constant and does not reflect the corporate actions of individual companies in the SPX. Index divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the SPX closing level.\nChanges in a company\u2019s shares outstanding of 5.00% or more due to mergers, acquisitions, public offerings, tender offers, Dutch auctions, or exchange offers are made as soon as reasonably possible. Share changes due to mergers or acquisitions of publicly held companies that trade on a major exchange are implemented when the transaction occurs, even if both of the companies are not in the same headline index, and regardless of the size of the change. All other changes of 5.00% or more (due to, for example, company stock repurchases, private placements, redemptions, exercise of options, warrants, conversion of preferred stock, notes, debt, equity participation units, at-the-market offerings, or other recapitalizations) are made weekly and are announced on Fridays for implementation after the close of trading on the following Friday. Changes of less than 5.00% are accumulated and made quarterly on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, and are usually announced two to five days prior.\nIf a change in a company\u2019s shares outstanding of 5.00% or more causes a company\u2019s IWF to change by five percentage points or more, the IWF is updated at the same time as the share change. IWF changes resulting from partial tender offers are considered on a case by case basis.\n**Historical Performance of the SPX**\nThe following graph sets forth the daily historical performance of the SPX in the period from January 2, 2020 through the Strike Date. We obtained this historical data from Bloomberg L.P. We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information obtained from Bloomberg L.P.

BofAS may not make sales in this offering to any of its discretionary accounts without the prior written approval of the account holder.\nWe expect to deliver the Notes against payment therefor in New York, New York on a date that is greater than one business day following the pricing date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, if the initial settlement of the Notes occurs more than one business day from the pricing date, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than one business day prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.\nUnder our distribution agreement with BofAS, BofAS will purchase the Notes from us as principal at the public offering price indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, less the indicated underwriting discount, if any. BofAS will sell the Notes to other broker-dealers that will participate in the offering and that are not affiliated with us, at an agreed discount to the principal amount. Each of those broker-dealers may sell the Notes to one or more additional broker-dealers. BofAS has informed us that these discounts may vary from dealer to dealer and that not all dealers will purchase or repurchase the Notes at the same discount. Certain dealers who purchase the Notes for sale to certain fee-based advisory accounts may forgo some or all of their selling concessions, fees or commissions. The public offering price for investors purchasing the Notes in these fee-based advisory accounts may be as low as $998.00 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes.\nBofAS and any of our other broker-dealer affiliates may use this pricing supplement and the accompanying product supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus for offers and sales in secondary market transactions and market-making transactions in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to engage in such secondary market transactions and/or market-making transactions. These broker-dealer affiliates may act as principal or agent in these transactions, and any such sales will be made at prices related to prevailing market conditions at the time of the sale.\nAt BofAS\u2019s discretion, for a short, undetermined initial period after the issuance of the Notes, BofAS may offer to buy the Notes in the secondary market at a price that may exceed the initial estimated value of the Notes. Any price offered by BofAS for the Notes will be based on then-prevailing market conditions and other considerations, including the performance of the Underlyings and the remaining term of the Notes. However, none of us, the Guarantor, BofAS or any of our other affiliates is obligated to purchase your Notes at any price or at any time, and we cannot assure you that any party will purchase your Notes at a price that equals or exceeds the initial estimated value of the Notes.\nAny price that BofAS may pay to repurchase the Notes will depend upon then prevailing market conditions, the creditworthiness of us and the Guarantor, and transaction costs. At certain times, this price may be higher than or lower than the initial estimated value of the Notes.\n**European Economic Area and United Kingdom**\nNone of this pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying prospectus or the accompanying prospectus supplement is a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation (as defined below). This pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement have been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d) or in the United Kingdom (each, a \u201cRelevant State\u201d) will only be made to a legal entity which is a qualified investor under the Prospectus Regulation (\u201cQualified Investors\u201d). Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in that Relevant State of Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement may only do so with respect to Qualified Investors. Neither BofA Finance nor BAC has authorized, nor does it authorize, the making of any offer of Notes other than to Qualified Investors. The expression \u201cProspectus Regulation\u201d means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.\n**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA AND UNITED KINGDOM RETAIL INVESTORS** \u2013 The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the United Kingdom. For these purposes: (a) a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended (\u201cMiFID II\u201d); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the Insurance Distribution Directive) where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation; and (b) the expression \u201coffer\u201d includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended (the \u201cPRIIPs Regulation\u201d) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.\n**United Kingdom**\nThe communication of this pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying prospectus supplement, the accompanying\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-22 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500\u00ae Index   \n---  \nprospectus and any other document or materials relating to the issue of the Notes offered hereby is not being made, and such documents and/or materials have not been approved, by an authorized person for the purposes of Section 21 of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the \u201cFSMA\u201d).

The related guarantee is BAC\u2019s obligation. As is the case for all of our and BAC\u2019s respective debt securities, including our market-linked notes, the economic terms of the Notes reflect our and BAC\u2019s actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition, because market-linked notes result in increased operational, funding and liability management costs to us and BAC, BAC typically borrows the funds under these types of notes at a rate, which we refer to in this pricing supplement as BAC\u2019s internal funding rate, that is more favorable to BAC than the rate that it might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security. This generally relatively lower internal funding rate, which is reflected in the economic terms of the Notes, along with the fees and charges associated with market-linked notes, typically results in the initial estimated value of the Notes on the pricing date being less than their public offering price.\nIn order to meet our payment obligations on the Notes, at the time we issue the Notes, we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options, put options or other derivatives) with BofAS or one of our other affiliates. The terms of these hedging arrangements are determined based upon terms provided by BofAS and its affiliates, and take into account a number of factors, including our and BAC\u2019s creditworthiness, interest rate movements, the volatility of the Underlyings, the tenor of the Notes and the hedging arrangements. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.\nBofAS has advised us that the hedging arrangements will include hedging related charges, reflecting the costs associated with, and our affiliates\u2019 profit earned from, these hedging arrangements. Since hedging entails risk and may be influenced by unpredictable market forces, actual profits or losses from these hedging transactions may be more or less than any expected amounts.\nFor further information, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page PS-5 and \u201cSupplemental Use of Proceeds\u201d on page PS-20 of the accompanying product supplement.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017609/image_001.jpg) |  CONTINGENT INCOME ISSUER CALLABLE YIELD NOTES | PS-24 |   \n---|---|---  \n* * *\nContingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100\u00ae Index, the Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500\u00ae Index   \n---  \nU.S. Federal Income Tax Summary\nThe following summary of the material U.S. federal income and estate tax considerations of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Notes supplements, and to the extent inconsistent supersedes, the discussion under \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d in the accompanying prospectus and is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations.

If on the Observation Date theclosing level of the Underlying is greater than or equal to the Autocall Barrier, which is a level of the Underlying equal to a percentage of the Initial Value, as indicated below, then we will automatically call the Notes and pay you a Call Price equal to the Stated Principal Amount plus a Call Return based on the Call Return Rate, and no further amounts will be owed to you. If the Notes are not automatically called on the Observation Date, and the Underlying Return is positive, BofA Finance will repay the Stated Principal Amount of the Notes at maturity plus a return equal to the Underlying Return multiplied by the Upside Gearing of between [1.60 and 1.80] (to be set on the Trade Date). If the Notes are not automatically called on the Observation Date, and both (i) the Underlying Return is zero or negative and (ii) the Final Value is greater than or equal to the Downside Threshold of 90% of the Initial Value, BofA Finance will repay the Stated Principal Amount of the Notes at maturity. However, if the Notes are not automatically called on the Observation Date, and both (i) the Underlying Return is negative and (ii) the Final Value is less than the Downside Threshold, you will receive less than the Stated Principal Amount at maturity, resulting in a loss that is equal to the percentage decline in the level of the Underlying in excess of the 10% Buffer. In this case, you could lose up to 90% of your initial investment. **Investing in the Notes involves significant risks. You will not receive coupon payments during the approximate 3 year term of the Notes. You may lose up to 90% of your initial investment. You will not receive dividends or other distributions paid on any stocks included in the Underlying. Downside exposure to the Underlying is buffered only if you hold the Notes to maturity. Any payment on the Notes, including any repayment of the Stated Principal Amount, is subject to the creditworthiness of BofA Finance and the Guarantor and is not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party.**  \n**Features** |  |  **Key Dates 1**  \n\u2751**Automatic Call Feature** \u2014 We will automatically call the Notes for a Call Price equal to the Stated Principal Amount plus a Call Return based on the Call Return Rate if theclosing level of the Underlying is greater than or equal to the Autocall Barrier on the Observation Date (occurring approximately one year after issuance). \u2751 **Enhanced Growth Potential** \u2014If the Notes have not been automatically called and the Underlying Return is positive, BofA Finance will repay the Stated Principal Amount of the Notes at maturity plus a return equal to the Underlying Return multiplied by the Upside Gearing.

However, if (i) a Market Disruption Event occurs on the first scheduled Trading Day following that Non-Observation Date or (ii) the first scheduled Trading Day following that Non-Observation Date is determined by the calculation agent not to be a Trading Day by reason of an extraordinary event, occurrence, declaration or otherwise, the closing level of the Underlying for the Observation Date will be determined (or, if not determinable, estimated) by the calculation agent in a manner which the calculation agent considers commercially reasonable under the circumstances on such first scheduled Trading Day following that Non-Observation Date, regardless of the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event or non-Trading Day on that day.  \n---  \n* * *\n1 Subject to change and will be set forth in the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes. |  2 See \u201cSupplement to the Plan of Distribution; Role of BofAS and Conflicts of Interest\u201d in this pricing supplement for additional information.   \n---|---  \nPS-4\n* * *\n**Investment Timeline**  \n---  \n|  |  |   \n|  **Trade Date** |  |  The closing level of the Underlying (its Initial Value) is observed, the Upside Gearing is set and the Autocall Barrier and Downside Threshold for the Underlying are determined.  \n|  ![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017608/image_002.jpg) |  |   \n|  **Observation Date****(occurring approximately one year after issuance)** |  |  The closing level of the Underlying will be determined on the Observation Date.

ANY PAYMENT ON THE NOTES IS SUBJECT TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF BOFA FINANCE AND THE GUARANTOR.**\nPS-5\n* * *\n**Risk Factors**  \n---  \n_Your investment in the Notes entails significant risks, many of which differ from those of a conventional debt security. Your decision to purchase the Notes should be made only after carefully considering the risks of an investment in the Notes, including those discussed below, with your advisors in light of your particular circumstances. The Notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about significant elements of the Notes or financial matters in general. You should carefully review the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections beginning on page PS-5 of the accompany_ _ing product supplement, page S-__6_ _of the accompanying prospectus supplement and page 7 of the accompanying prospectus identified_ _on page PS-2_ _above._\n**_Structure-related Risks_**\n\u2666 |  **Your investment may result in a loss; there is no guaranteed return of principal.** There is no fixed principal repayment amount on the Notes at maturity. If the Final Value is less than the Downside Threshold, at maturity, you will lose 1% of the Stated Principal Amount for each 1% that the Final Value is less than the Downside Threshold. In that case, you will lose a significant portion of your investment in the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The Notes do not bear interest.** Unlike a conventional debt security, no interest payments will be paid over the term of the Notes, regardless of the extent to which the Final Value exceeds the Initial Value.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **If your Notes are called, the appreciation potential of the Notes will be limited.** If your Notes are called, your total return on the Notes will be limited to the Call Return. If your Notes are called you will not receive the potentially higher return represented by the Payment at Maturity and you will not participate in any potential appreciation of the Underlying. As a result, if your notes are called the return on an investment in the Notes may be significantly less than the return on a hypothetical direct investment in the stocks included in the Underlying. Furthermore, if the Notes are automatically called, you may be unable to invest in other securities with a similar level of risk that could provide a return that is similar to the Notes. In addition, if the Notes are automatically called, you will not benefit from the Upside Gearing that applies to the Payment at Maturity if the Underlying Return is positive. Because the Upside Gearing does not apply to the payment upon an automatic call, the payment upon an automatic call may be significantly less than the Payment at Maturity would be for the same level of appreciation in the Underlying.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The determination as to whether the Notes will be automatically called and the Payment at Maturity will not reflect the levels of the Underlying other than on the Observation Date or Valuation Date, as applicable.** The levels of the Underlying during the term of the Notes other than on the Observation Date or Valuation Date, as applicable, will not affect the determination as to whether the Notes will be automatically called or payments on the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, investors should generally be aware of the performance of the Underlying while holding the Notes, as the performance of the Underlying may influence the market value of the Notes. The calculation agent will determine whether the Notes are automatically called or will calculate the Payment at Maturity, as applicable, by comparing only the Autocall Barrier to the closing level of the Underlying on the Observation Date or by comparing only the Initial Value or the Downside Threshold to the Final Value, as applicable. No other levels of the Underlying will be taken into account. As a result, the Notes will not be automatically called if the closing level of the Underlying is less than the Autocall Barrier on the Observation Date, even if the level of the Underlying was always above the Autocall Barrier on each other day during the term of the Notes. Similarly, if the Notes are not automatically called and the Final Value is less than the Downside Threshold, you will receive less than the Stated Principal Amount at maturity, even if the level of the Underlying was above the Downside Threshold prior to the Valuation Date.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **Downside exposure to the Underlying is buffered only if you hold the Notes to maturity.** You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity. If you are able to sell your Notes in the secondary market prior to maturity, you may have to sell them at a loss relative to your initial investment even if the level of the Underlying at that time is equal to or greater than the Downside Threshold. Any payment on the Notes is subject to the credit risk of BofA Finance, as issuer, and BAC, as guarantor.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The Upside Gearing applies only at maturity.** You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity. If you are able to sell your Notes in the secondary market prior to maturity, the price you receive will likely not reflect the full economic value of the Upside Gearing, and the return you realize may be less than the then-current underlying return multiplied by the Upside Gearing, even if such return is positive. You can receive the full benefit of the Upside Gearing only if you hold your Notes to maturity. Any payment on the Notes is subject to the credit risk of BofA Finance, as issuer, and BAC, as guarantor.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **Your return on the Notes may be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.** Any return that you receive on the Notes may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased a conventional debt security with the same Maturity Date. As a result, your investment in the Notes may not reflect the full opportunity cost to you when you consider factors, such as inflation, that affect the time value of money. In addition, if interest rates increase during the term of the Notes, the Call Return Rate may be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **Any payment on the Notes is subject to our credit risk and the credit risk of the Guarantor, and actual or perceived changes in our or the Guarantor\u2019s creditworthiness are expected to affect the value of the Notes.** The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. Any payment on the Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor. The Notes are not guaranteed by any entity other than the Guarantor. As a result, your receipt of any payment on the Notes will be dependent upon our ability and the ability of the Guarantor to repay our respective obligations under the Notes on the Call Settlement Date or the Maturity Date, as applicable, regardless of the level of the Underlying as compared to the Downside Threshold, Autocall Barrier or Initial Value, as applicable. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition or the financial condition of the Guarantor will be on the Call Settlement Date or the Maturity Date. If we and the Guarantor  \n---|---  \nPS-6\n* * *\n|  become unable to meet our respective financial obligations as they become due, you may not receive the amount payable under the terms of the Notes and you could lose all of your initial investment.  \n---|---  \nIn addition, our credit ratings and the credit ratings of the Guarantor are assessments by ratings agencies of our respective abilities to pay our obligations. Consequently, our or the Guarantor\u2019s perceived creditworthiness and actual or anticipated decreases in our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit ratings or increases in the spread between the yield on our respective securities and the yield on U.S. Treasury securities (the \u201ccredit spread\u201d) prior to the Maturity Date of your Notes may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. However, because your return on the Notes depends upon factors in addition to our ability and the ability of the Guarantor to pay our respective obligations, such as the value of the Underlying, an improvement in our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit ratings will not reduce the other investment risks related to the Notes.\n\u2666 |  **We are a finance subsidiary and, as such, have no independent assets, operations or revenues.** We are a finance subsidiary of BAC, have no operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of our debt securities that are guaranteed by the Guarantor, and are dependent upon the Guarantor and/or its other subsidiaries to meet our obligations under the Notes in the ordinary course.Therefore, our ability to make payments on the Notes may be limited.  \n---|---  \n**_Valuation-__and Market-related Risks_**\n\u2666 |  **The public offering price you pay for the Notes will exceed their initial estimated value.** The range of initial estimated values of the Notes that is provided on the cover page of this preliminary pricing supplement, and the initial estimated value as of the Trade Date that will be provided in the final pricing supplement, are each estimates only, determined as of a particular point in time by reference to our and our affiliates' pricing models. These pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables, including our credit spreads and those of the Guarantor, the Guarantor\u2019s internal funding rate, mid-market terms on hedging transactions, expectations on interest rates, dividends and volatility, price-sensitivity analysis, and the expected term of the Notes. These pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity, their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and lower than their initial estimated value. This is due to, among other things, changes in the level of the Underlying, changes in the Guarantor\u2019s internal funding rate, and the inclusion in the public offering price of the underwriting discount, if any, and the hedging related charges, all as further described in \"Structuring the Notes\" below. These factors, together with various credit, market and economic factors over the term of the Notes, are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The initial estimated value does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which we, BAC, BofAS or any of our other affiliates would be willing to purchase your Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time.** The value of your Notes at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy, including the performance of the Underlying, our and BAC\u2019s creditworthiness and changes in market conditions.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The price of the Notes that may be paid by BofAS in any secondary market (if BofAS makes a market, which it is not required to do), as well as the price which may be reflected on customer account statements, will be higher than the then-current estimated value of the Notes for a limited time period after the Trade Date.** As agreed by BofAS and UBS, for approximately an eight-month period after the Trade Date, to the extent BofAS offers to buy the Notes in the secondary market, it will do so at a price that will exceed the estimated value of the Notes at that time. The amount of this excess, which represents a portion of the hedging-related charges expected to be realized by BofAS and UBS over the term of the Notes, will decline to zero on a straight line basis over that eight-month period. Accordingly, the estimated value of your Notes during this initial eight-month period may be lower than the value shown on your customer account statements. Thereafter, if BofAS buys or sells your Notes, it will do so at prices that reflect the estimated value determined by reference to its pricing models at that time. Any price at any time after the Trade Date will be based on the then-prevailing market conditions and other considerations, including the performance of the Underlying and the remaining term of the Notes. However, none of us, the Guarantor, BofAS or any other party is obligated to purchase your Notes at any price or at any time, and we cannot assure you that any party will purchase your Notes at a price that equals or exceeds the initial estimated value of the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **We cannot assure you that a trading market for your Notes will ever develop or be maintained.** We will not list the Notes on any securities exchange. We cannot predict how the Notes will trade in any secondary market or whether that market will be liquid or illiquid.  \n---|---  \nThe development of a trading market for the Notes will depend on the Guarantor\u2019s financial performance and other factors, including changes in the level of the Underlying. The number of potential buyers of your Notes in any secondary market may be limited. We anticipate that BofAS will act as a market-maker for the Notes, but none of us, the Guarantor or BofAS is required to do so. There is no assurance that any party will be willing to purchase your Notes at any price in any secondary market. BofAS may discontinue its market-making activities as to the Notes at any time. To the extent that BofAS engages in any market-making activities, it may bid for or offer the Notes. Any price at which BofAS may bid for, offer, purchase, or sell any Notes may differ from the values determined by pricing models that it may use, whether as a result of dealer discounts, mark-ups, or other transaction costs. These bids, offers, or completed transactions may affect the prices, if any, at which the Notes might otherwise trade in the market. In addition, if at any time BofAS were to cease acting as a market-maker as to the Notes, it is likely that there would be significantly less liquidity in the secondary market. In such a case, the price at which the Notes could be sold likely would be lower than if an active market existed.\n\u2666 |  **Economic and market factors have affected the terms of the Notes and may affect the market value of the Notes prior to maturity or automatic call, as applicable.** Because market-linked notes, including the Notes, can be thought of as having a debt component and a derivative component, factors that influence the values of debt instruments and options and other derivatives will also affect the terms and features of the Notes at issuance and the market price of the Notes prior to maturity or automatic call, as applicable. These factors include the level of the Underlying and the securities included in the Underlying; the volatility of the Underlying and the securities included in the Underlying; the  \n---|---  \nPS-7\n* * *\n|  dividend rate paid on the securities held by the Underlying, if applicable; the time remaining to the maturity of the Notes; interest rates in the markets; geopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, force majeure and regulatory or judicial events; whether the level of the Underlying is currently or has been less than the Downside Threshold; the availability of comparable instruments; the creditworthiness of BofA Finance, as issuer, and BAC, as guarantor; and the then current bid-ask spread for the Notes and the factors discussed under \u201c\u2014 Trading and hedging activities by us, the Guarantor and any of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates, may create conflicts of interest with you and may affect your return on the Notes and their market value\u201d below. These factors are unpredictable and interrelated and may offset or magnify each other.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **Greater expected volatility generally indicates an increased risk of loss at maturity.** Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the level of the Underlying over a period of time. The greater the expected volatility of the Underlying at the time the terms of the Notes are set, the greater the expectation is at that time that the Notes will not be automatically called and that you may lose a significant portion of the Stated Principal Amount at maturity. In addition, the economic terms of the Notes, including the Call Return Rate, the Autocall Barrier and the Downside Threshold, are based, in part, on the expected volatility of the Underlying at the time the terms of the Notes are set, where higher expected volatility will generally be reflected in a higher Call Return Rate than the fixed rate we would pay on conventional debt securities of the same maturity and/or on otherwise comparable securities and/or a lower Autocall Barrier or Downside Threshold as compared to otherwise comparable securities. However, the Underlying's volatility can change significantly over the term of the Notes, and a relatively higher Call Return Rate and/or a lower Autocall Barrier or Downside Threshold may not necessarily indicate that the Notes have a greater likelihoodof being automatically called or of a return of principal at maturity. You should be willing to accept the downside market risk of the Underlying and the potential to lose a significant portion of your initial investment.  \n---|---  \n**_Conflict-related Risks_**\n\u2666 |  **Trading and hedging activities by us, the Guarantor and any of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates, may create conflicts of interest with you and may affect your return on the Notes and their market value.** We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates, may buy or sell the securities held by or included in the Underlying, or futures or options contracts on the Underlying or those securities, or other listed or over-the-counter derivative instruments linked to the Underlying or those securities. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates also may issue or underwrite other financial instruments with returns based upon the Underlying. We expect to enter into arrangements or adjust or close out existing transactions to hedge our obligations under the Notes. We, the Guarantor or our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates also may enter into hedging transactions relating to other notes or instruments, some of which may have returns calculated in a manner related to that of the Notes offered hereby. We or UBS may enter into such hedging arrangements with one of our or their affiliates. Our affiliates or their affiliates may enter into additional hedging transactions with other parties relating to the Notes and the Underlying. This hedging activity is expected to result in a profit to those engaging in the hedging activity, which could be more or less than initially expected, or the hedging activity could also result in a loss. We and our affiliates and UBS and its affiliates will price these hedging transactions with the intent to realize a profit, regardless of whether the value of the Notes increases or decreases. Any profit in connection with such hedging activities will be in addition to any other compensation that we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates receive for the sale of the Notes, which creates an additional incentive to sell the Notes to you. While we, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates may from time to time own securities represented by the Underlying, except to the extent that BAC\u2019s or UBS Group AG\u2019s (the parent company of UBS) common stock may be included in the Underlying, as applicable, we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates do not control any company included in the Underlying, and have not verified any disclosure made by any other company. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates may execute such purchases or sales for our own or their own accounts, for business reasons, or in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes. The transactions described above may present a conflict of interest between your interest in the Notes and the interests we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates may have in our or their proprietary accounts, in facilitating transactions, including block trades, for our or their other customers, and in accounts under our or their management.  \n---|---  \nThe transactions described above may affect the value of the Underlying in a manner that could be adverse to your investment in the Notes. On or before the Trade Date, any purchases or sales by us, the Guarantor or our other affiliates, including BofAS or others on its behalf, and UBS and its affiliates (including for the purpose of hedging some or all of our anticipated exposure in connection with the Notes) may affect the value of the Underlying. Consequently, the value of the Underlying may change subsequent to the Trade Date, which may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. In addition, these activities may decrease the market value of your Notes prior to maturity, and may affect the amounts to be paid on the Notes. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates may purchase or otherwise acquire a long or short position in the Notes and may hold or resell the Notes. For example, BofAS may enter into these transactions in connection with any market making activities in which it engages. We cannot assure you that these activities will not adversely affect the value of the Underlying, the market value of your Notes prior to maturity or the amounts payable on the Notes.\n\u2666 |  **There may be potential conflicts of interest involving the calculation agent, which is an affiliate of ours.** We have the right to appoint and remove the calculation agent. One of our affiliates will be the calculation agent for the Notes and, as such, will make a variety of determinations relating to the Notes, including the amounts that will be paid on the Notes. Under some circumstances, these duties could result in a conflict of interest between its status as our affiliate and its responsibilities as calculation agent.  \n---|---  \n**_Underlying-__related Risks_**\n\u2666 |  **The publisher of the Underlying may adjust the Underlying in a way that affects its level, and the publisher has no obligation to consider your interests.** The publisher of the Underlying can add, delete, or substitute the components included in the Underlying or make other methodological changes that could change its level. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of your Notes.  \n---|---  \nPS-8\n* * *\n\u2666 |  **The Notes are subject to the market risk of the Underlying.** The return on the Notes, which may be negative, is directly linked to the performance of the Underlying and indirectly linked to the value of the securities included in the Underlying. The level of the Underlying can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the Underlying and the securities included in the Underlying and the issuers of such securities, such as stock price volatility, earnings and financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market or commodity market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The Notes are subject to risks associated with mid-size capitalization companies.** The stocks comprising the MID are issued by companies with mid-sized market capitalization. The stock prices of mid-size companies may be more volatile than stock prices of large capitalization companies. Mid-size capitalization companies may be less able to withstand adverse economic, market, trade and competitive conditions relative to larger companies. Mid-size capitalization companies may also be more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products or services.  \n---|---  \n**_Tax-__related Risks_**\n\u2666 |  **The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, and may be adverse to a holder of the Notes.** No statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the Notes or securities similar to the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are not certain. Under the terms of the Notes, you will have agreed with us to treat the Notes as single financial contracts, as described below under \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Summary\u2014General.\u201d If the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) were successful in asserting an alternative characterization for the Notes, the timing and character of gain or loss with respect to the Notes may differ.

The information reflects the policies of, and is subject to change by, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (\u201cSPDJI\u201d), the sponsor of the MID. We refer to SPDJI as the \u201cUnderlying Sponsor.\u201d The Underlying Sponsor, which licenses the copyright and all other rights to the Underlying, has no obligation to continue to publish, and may discontinue publication of, the Underlying. The consequences of the Underlying Sponsor discontinuing publication of the Underlying are discussed in \u201cDescription of the Notes\u2014Discontinuance of an Index\u201d in the accompanying product supplement. None of us, the Guarantor, the calculation agent, or either Selling Agent accepts any responsibility for the calculation, maintenance or publication of the Underlying or any successor index.\nNone of us, the Guarantor, the Selling Agents or any of our or their respective affiliates makes any representation to you as to the future performance of the Underlying.\nYou should make your own investigation into the Underlying.\n**The S &P MidCap 400\u00ae Index**\nThe MID is intended to provide a benchmark for the performance of publicly traded mid-sized U.S. companies. The MID tracks the stock price movement of 400 companies with mid-sized market capitalizations. The calculation of the level of the MID is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of 400 companies as of a particular time compared to the aggregate average market value of the common stocks of 400 similar companies on the base date of June 28, 1991.\nThe MID includes companies from eleven main groups: Information Technology; Industrials; Financials; Consumer Discretionary; Health Care; Real Estate; Materials; Utilities; Consumer Staples; Communication Services and Energy. The MID sponsor, SPDJI, may from time to time, in its sole discretion, add companies to, or delete companies from, the MID to achieve the objectives stated above.\nSPDJI calculates the MID by reference to the prices of the constituent stocks of the MID without taking account of the value of dividends paid on those stocks. As a result, the return on the Notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the MID constituent stocks and received the dividends paid on those stocks.\n_Computation of the MID_\nWhile SPDJI currently employs the following methodology to calculate the MID, no assurance can be given that SPDJI will not modify or change this methodology in a manner that may affect the payment on the Notes.\nHistorically, the market value of any component stock of the MID was calculated as the product of the market price per share and the number of then outstanding shares of such component stock. In March 2005, SPDJI began shifting the MID halfway from a market capitalization weighted formula to a float-adjusted formula, before moving the MID to full float adjustment on September 16, 2005. SPDJI\u2019s criteria for selecting stocks for the MID did not change with the shift to float adjustment. However, the adjustment affects each company\u2019s weight in the MID.\nUnder float adjustment, the share counts used in calculating the MID reflect only those shares that are available to investors, not all of a company\u2019s outstanding shares. Float adjustment excludes shares that are closely held by control groups, other publicly traded companies or government agencies.\nIn September 2012, all shareholdings representing more than 5% of a stock\u2019s outstanding shares, other than holdings by \u201cblock owners,\u201d were removed from the float for purposes of calculating the MID. Generally, these \u201ccontrol holders\u201d will include officers and directors, private equity, venture capital and special equity firms, other publicly traded companies that hold shares for control, strategic partners, holders of restricted shares, ESOPs, employee and family trusts, foundations associated with the company, holders of unlisted share classes of stock, government entities at all levels (other than government retirement/pension funds) and any individual person who controls a 5% or greater stake in a company as reported in regulatory filings. However, holdings by block owners, such as depositary banks, pension funds, mutual funds and ETF providers, 401(k) plans of the company, government retirement/pension funds, investment funds of insurance companies, asset managers and investment funds, independent foundations and savings and investment plans, will ordinarily be considered part of the float.\nTreasury stock, stock options, equity participation units, warrants, preferred stock, convertible stock, and rights are not part of the float. Shares held in a trust to allow investors in countries outside the country of domicile, such as depositary shares and Canadian exchangeable shares are normally part of the float unless those shares form a control block. If a company has multiple classes of stock outstanding, shares in an unlisted or non-traded class are treated as a control block.\nFor each stock, an investable weight factor (\u201cIWF\u201d) is calculated by dividing the available float shares by the total shares outstanding. Available float shares are defined as the total shares outstanding less shares held by control holders. This calculation is subject to a 5% minimum threshold for control blocks. For example, if a company\u2019s officers and directors hold 3% of the company\u2019s shares, and no other control group holds 5% of the company\u2019s shares, SPDJI would assign that company an IWF of 1.00, as no control group meets the 5% threshold. However, if a company\u2019s officers and directors hold 3% of the company\u2019s shares and another control group holds 20% of the company\u2019s shares, SPDJI would assign an IWF of 0.77, reflecting the fact that 23% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares are considered to be held for control. As of July 31, 2017, companies with multiple\nPS-12\n* * *\nshare class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the MID. Constituents of the MID prior to July 31, 2017 with multiple share class lines will be grandfathered in and continue to be included in the MID. If a constituent company of the MID reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure, that company will remain in the MID at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee in order to minimize turnover.\nThe MID is calculated using a base-weighted aggregate methodology. The level of the MID reflects the total market value of all 400 component stocks relative to the base date of June 28, 1991. An indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order to make the level easier to work with and track over time. The actual total market value of the component stocks on the base date has been set to an indexed level of 100. This is often indicated by the notation June 28, 1991 = 100. In practice, the daily calculation of the MID is computed by dividing the total market value of the component stocks by the \u201cindex divisor.\u201d By itself, the MID divisor is an arbitrary number. However, in the context of the calculation of the MID, it serves as a link to the original base period level of the MID. The MID divisor keeps the MID comparable over time and is the manipulation point for all adjustments to the MID, which is index maintenance.\n_Index Maintenance_\nIndex maintenance includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to company restructuring or spinoffs. Some corporate actions, such as stock splits and stock dividends, require changes in the common shares outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the MID, and do not require index divisor adjustments.\nTo prevent the level of the MID from changing due to corporate actions, corporate actions which affect the total market value of the MID require an index divisor adjustment. By adjusting the MID divisor for the change in market value, the level of the MID remains constant and does not reflect the corporate actions of individual companies in the MID. Index divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the MID closing level.\nChanges in a company\u2019s shares outstanding of 5.00% or more due to mergers, acquisitions, public offerings, tender offers, Dutch auctions, or exchange offers are made as soon as reasonably possible. Share changes due to mergers or acquisitions of publicly held companies that trade on a major exchange are implemented when the transaction occurs, even if both of the companies are not in the same headline index, and regardless of the size of the change. All other changes of 5.00% or more (due to, for example, company stock repurchases, private placements, redemptions, exercise of options, warrants, conversion of preferred stock, notes, debt, equity participation units, at-the-market offerings, or other recapitalizations) are made weekly and are announced on Fridays for implementation after the close of trading on the following Friday. Changes of less than 5.00% are accumulated and made quarterly on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, and are usually announced two to five days prior.\nIf a change in a company\u2019s shares outstanding of 5.00% or more causes a company\u2019s IWF to change by five percentage points or more, the IWF is updated at the same time as the share change. IWF changes resulting from partial tender offers are considered on a case by case basis.\n_Historical Performance of the_ _MID_\nThe following graph sets forth the daily historical performance of the MID in the period from January 2, 2020 through October 16, 2025. We obtained this historical data from Bloomberg L.P. We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information obtained from Bloomberg L.P. The horizontal line in the graph represents the MID\u2019s hypothetical Downside Threshold of 2,894.98 (rounded to two decimal places), which is 90.00% of the MID\u2019s hypothetical Initial Value of 3,216.64, which was its closing level on October 16, 2025. The actual Initial Value and Downside Threshold will be determined on the Trade Date.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017608/image_003.jpg)\nPS-13\n* * *\nThis historical data on the MID is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of the MID or what the value of the Notes may be.

UBS, as selling agent for sales of the Notes, expects to purchase from BofAS, and BofAS expects to sell to UBS, all of the Notes sold in this offering for $9.75 per Note. UBS proposes to offer the Notes to the public at a price of $10.00 per Note. UBS will receive an underwriting discount of $0.25 for each Note it sells to the public. The underwriting discount will be received by UBS and its financial advisors collectively. If all of the Notes are not sold at the initial offering price, BofAS may change the public offering price and other selling terms.\nBofAS, a broker-dealer affiliate of ours, is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u201cFINRA\u201d) and will participate as lead selling agent in the distribution of the Notes. Accordingly, the offering of the Notes will conform to the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121. BofAS may not make sales in this offering to any of its discretionary accounts without the prior written approval of the account holder.\nWe will deliver the Notes against payment therefor in New York, New York on a date that is greater than one business day following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than one business day prior to the Issue Date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.\nBofAS and any of our other broker-dealer affiliates may use this pricing supplement, and the accompanying product supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus, for offers and sales in secondary market transactions and market-making transactions in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to engage in such secondary market transactions and/or market-making transactions. These broker-dealer affiliates may act as principal or agent in these transactions, and any such sales will be made at prices related to prevailing market conditions at the time of the sale.\nAs agreed by BofAS and UBS, for approximately an eight-month period after the Trade Date, to the extent BofAS offers to buy the Notes in the secondary market, it will do so at a price that will exceed the estimated value of the Notes at that time. The amount of this excess will decline on a straight line basis over that period. Thereafter, if BofAS buys or sells your Notes, it will do so at prices that reflect the estimated value determined by reference to its pricing models at that time. Any price at any time after the Trade Date will be based on then-prevailing market conditions and other considerations, including the performance of the Underlying and the remaining term of the Notes. However, none of us, the Guarantor, BofAS, UBS or any other party is obligated to purchase your Notes at any price or at any time, and we cannot assure you that any party will purchase your Notes at a price that equals or exceeds the initial estimated value of the Notes.\nAny price that BofAS may pay to repurchase the Notes will depend upon then prevailing market conditions, the creditworthiness of us and the Guarantor, and transaction costs. At certain times, this price may be higher than or lower than the initial estimated value of the Notes.\n**Sales Outside of the United States**\nThe Notes have not been approved for public sale in any jurisdiction outside of the United States. There has been no registration or filing as to the Notes with any regulatory, securities, banking, or local authority outside of the United States and no action has been taken by BofA Finance, BAC, BofAS or any other affiliate of BAC, or by UBS or any of its affiliates, to offer the Notes in any jurisdiction other than the United States. As such, these Notes are made available to investors outside of the United States only in jurisdictions where it is lawful to make such offer or sale and only under circumstances that will result in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including private placement requirements.\nFurther, no offer or sale of the securities is permitted with regards to the following jurisdictions:\n\u25cf |  Australia  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Barbados  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Belgium  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Crimea  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Cuba  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Curacao Sint Maarten  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Gibraltar  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Indonesia  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Iran  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Italy  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Kazakhstan  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Malaysia  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  New Zealand  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  North Korea  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Norway  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Russia  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Syria  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  Venezuela  \n---|---  \nPS-15\n* * *\nYou are urged to carefully review the selling restrictions that may be applicable to your jurisdiction beginning on page S-56 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.\n**European Economic Area and United Kingdom**\nNone of this pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying prospectus or the accompanying prospectus supplement is a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation (as defined below).

The related guarantees are BAC\u2019s obligations. Any payments on the Notes depend on the credit risk of BofA Finance and BAC and on the performance of the Underlying. The economic terms of the Notes reflect our and BAC\u2019s actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing and are based on BAC\u2019s internal funding rate, which is the rate it would pay to borrow funds through the issuance of market-linked notes, and the economic terms of certain related hedging arrangements it enters into. BAC\u2019s internal funding rate is typically lower than the rate it would pay when it issues conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities. This difference in funding rate, as well as the underwriting discount and the hedging related charges described elsewhere in this pricing supplement, will reduce the economic terms of the Notes to you and the initial estimated value of the Notes. Due to these factors, the public offering price you pay to purchase the Notes will be greater than the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the Trade Date. On the cover page of this preliminary pricing supplement, we have provided the initial estimated value range for the Notes. The final pricing supplement will set forth the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the Trade Date.\nIn order to meet our payment obligations on the Notes, at the time we issue the Notes, we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options, put options or other derivatives) with BofAS or one of our other affiliates. The terms of these hedging arrangements are determined based upon terms provided by BofAS and its affiliates, and take into account a number of factors, including our and BAC\u2019s creditworthiness, interest rate movements, the volatility of the Underlying, the tenor of the Notes and the hedging arrangements. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.\nBofAS has advised us that the hedging arrangements will include hedging related charges, reflecting the costs associated with, and our affiliates\u2019 profit earned from, these hedging arrangements. Since hedging entails risk and may be influenced by unpredictable market forces, actual profits or losses from these hedging transactions may be more or less than any expected amounts.\nFor further information, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page PS-6 above and \u201cSupplemental Use of Proceeds\u201d on page PS-20 of the accompanying product supplement.\nPS-17\n* * *\n**U.S. Federal Income Tax Summary**  \n---  \nThe following summary of the material U.S. federal income and estate tax considerations of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Notes supplements, and to the extent inconsistent supersedes, the discussion under \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d in the accompanying prospectus and is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), regulations promulgated under the Code by the U.S. Treasury Department (\u201cTreasury\u201d) (including proposed and temporary regulations), rulings, current administrative interpretations and official pronouncements of the IRS, and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. This summary does not include any description of the tax laws of any state or local governments, or of any foreign government, that may be applicable to a particular holder.\nAlthough the Notes are issued by us, they will be treated as if they were issued by BAC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly throughout this tax discussion, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d are generally to BAC unless the context requires otherwise. \nThis summary is directed solely to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders that, except as otherwise specifically noted, will purchase the Notes upon original issuance and will hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, which generally means property held for investment, and that are not excluded from the discussion under \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d in the accompanying prospectus.\n_You should consult your own tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the Notes, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, foreign, or other tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in U.S. federal or other tax laws._\n**General**\nAlthough there is no statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addressing the characterization of the Notes, we intend to treat the Notes for all tax purposes as single financial contracts with respect to the Underlying and under the terms of the Notes, we and every investor in the Notes agree, in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary, to treat the Notes in accordance with such characterization. In the opinion of our counsel, Sidley Austin LLP, it is reasonable to treat the Notes as single financial contracts with respect to the Underlying. This discussion assumes that the Notes constitute single financial contracts with respect to the Underlying for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes did not constitute single financial contracts, the tax consequences described below would be materially different.\nThis characterization of the Notes is not binding on the IRS or the courts. No statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the Notes or any similar instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and no ruling is being requested from the IRS with respect to their proper characterization and treatment. Due to the absence of authorities on point, significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are not certain, and no assurance can be given that the IRS or any court will agree with the characterization and tax treatment described in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative characterizations.\nUnless otherwise stated, the following discussion is based on the characterization described above. The discussion in this section assumes that there is a significant possibility of a significant loss of principal on an investment in the Notes.\nWe will not attempt to ascertain whether the issuer of a component stock included in the Underlying would be treated as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d (\u201cPFIC\u201d), within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code, or a United States real property holding corporation, within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code. If the issuer of one or more stocks included in the Underlying were so treated, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could possibly apply to a holder of the Notes. You should refer to information filed with the SEC by the issuers of the component stocks included in the Underlying and consult your tax advisor regarding the possible consequences to you, if any, if any issuer of a component stock included in the Underlying is or becomes a PFIC or is or becomes a United States real property holding corporation.\n**U.S. Holders**\nUpon receipt of a cash payment at maturity or upon a sale, exchange or redemption of the Notes prior to maturity, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the U.S. Holder\u2019s tax basis in the Notes. A U.S. Holder\u2019s tax basis in the Notes will equal the amount paid by that holder to acquire them. This capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Notes for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n_Alternative Tax Treatments._ Due to the absence of authorities that directly address the proper tax treatment of the Notes, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding all possible alternative tax treatments of an investment in the Notes. In particular, the IRS could seek to subject the Notes to the Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments. If the IRS were successful in that regard, the timing and character of income on the Notes would be affected significantly. Among other things, a U.S. Holder would be required to accrue original issue discount every year at a \u201ccomparable yield\u201d determined at the time of issuance. In addition, any gain realized by a U.S. Holder at maturity or upon a sale, exchange or redemption of the Notes generally would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized at maturity or upon a sale, exchange\nPS-18\n* * *\nor redemption of the Notes generally would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the U.S. Holder\u2019s prior accruals of original issue discount, and as capital loss thereafter.\nThe IRS released Notice 2008-2 (the \u201cNotice\u201d), which sought comments from the public on the taxation of financial instruments currently taxed as \u201cprepaid forward contracts.\u201d This Notice addresses instruments such as the Notes. According to the Notice, the IRS and Treasury are considering whether a holder of an instrument such as the Notes should be required to accrue ordinary income on a current basis, regardless of whether any payments are made prior to maturity. It is not possible to determine what guidance the IRS and Treasury will ultimately issue, if any. Any such future guidance may affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain, or loss in respect of the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect.\nThe IRS and Treasury are also considering additional issues, including whether additional gain or loss from such instruments should be treated as ordinary or capital, whether foreign holders of such instruments should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accruals, whether Section 1260 of the Code, concerning certain \u201cconstructive ownership transactions,\u201d generally applies or should generally apply to such instruments, and whether any of these determinations depend on the nature of the underlying asset.\nIn addition, proposed Treasury regulations require the accrual of income on a current basis for contingent payments made under certain notional principal contracts. The preamble to the regulations states that the \u201cwait and see\u201d method of accounting does not properly reflect the economic accrual of income on those contracts, and requires current accrual of income for some contracts already in existence. While the proposed regulations do not apply to prepaid forward contracts, the preamble to the proposed regulations expresses the view that similar timing issues exist in the case of prepaid forward contracts. If the IRS or Treasury publishes future guidance requiring current economic accrual for contingent payments on prepaid forward contracts, it is possible that you could be required to accrue income over the term of the Notes.\nBecause of the absence of authority regarding the appropriate tax characterization of the Notes, it is also possible that the IRS could seek to characterize the Notes in a manner that results in tax consequences that are different from those described above. For example, the IRS could possibly assert that any gain or loss that a holder may recognize at maturity or upon the sale, exchange or redemption of the Notes should be treated as ordinary gain or loss.\nBecause the Underlying is an index that periodically rebalances, it is possible that the Notes could be treated as a series of single financial contracts, each of which matures on the next rebalancing date. If the Notes were properly characterized in such a manner, a U.S. Holder would be treated as disposing of the Notes on each rebalancing date in return for new Notes that mature on the next rebalancing date, and a U.S. Holder would accordingly likely recognize capital gain or loss on each rebalancing date equal to the difference between the holder\u2019s tax basis in the Notes (which would be adjusted to take into account any prior recognition of gain or loss) and the fair market value of the Notes on such date.\n**Non-U.S. Holders**\nExcept as discussed below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax for amounts paid in respect of the Notes provided that the Non-U.S. Holder complies with applicable certification requirements and that the payment is not effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a U.S. trade or business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, gain from the sale, exchange or redemption of the Notes or their settlement at maturity may be subject to U.S. federal income tax if that Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual and is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale, exchange, redemption or settlement and certain other conditions are satisfied.\nIf a Non-U.S. Holder of the Notes is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. and if any gain realized on the settlement at maturity, or upon sale, exchange or redemption of the Notes, is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business (and, if certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.), the Non-U.S. Holder, although exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax, generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such gain on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder. Such Non-U.S. Holders should read the material under the heading \u201c\u2014U.S. Holders,\u201d for a description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the Notes. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate provided by any applicable tax treaty) of a portion of its earnings and profits for the taxable year that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the U.S., subject to certain adjustments.\nA \u201cdividend equivalent\u201d payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States and such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a Non-U.S. Holder. Under Treasury regulations, payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (\u201cELIs\u201d) that are \u201cspecified ELIs\u201d may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference an interest in an \u201cunderlying security,\u201d which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However, IRS guidance provides that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1, 2027. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments, Non-U.S. Holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments, if any, under the Notes. However, it is possible that the Notes could be tr",

The Notes will pay a Coupon Payment, regardless of the performance of the Least Performing Underlying, on each monthly Coupon Payment Date. Beginning in January 2026, on any Call Date, the issuer may, in its sole discretion, call the Notes in whole, but not in part, and pay you the Stated Principal Amount plus the Coupon Payment otherwise due on such Call Date, and no further amounts will be owed to you. If the Notes have not previously been called, at maturity, the amount you receive will depend on the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying on the Final Observation Date. If the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying on the Final Observation Date is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold, you will receive the Stated Principal Amount at maturity (plus the final Coupon Payment). However, if the Notes have not been called prior to maturity and the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying on the Final Observation Date is less than its Downside Threshold, although you will receive the final Coupon Payment, you will receive less than the Stated Principal Amount at maturity, resulting in a loss that is proportionate to the decline in the closing level of the Least Performing Underlying from the Strike Date to the Final Observation Date, up to a 100% loss of your investment. The \u201cLeast Performing Underlying\u201d is the Underlying with the lowest Underlying Return from the Strike Date to the Final Observation Date. **Investing in the Notes involves significant risks. You may lose a substantial portion or all of your initial investment. The payment at maturity on the Notes will be based on the performance of the Least Performing Underlying. You will not benefit in any way from the performance of the other Underlying. You will therefore be adversely affected if either Underlying performs poorly, regardless of the performance of the other Underlying. You will not receive dividends or other distributions paid on any stocks included in the Underlyings or participate in any appreciation of either Underlying. The contingent repayment of the Stated Principal Amount applies only if you hold the Notes to maturity or earlier call by the issuer. Any payment on the Notes, including any repayment of the Stated Principal Amount, is subject to the creditworthiness of BofA Finance and the Guarantor and is not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party.**  \n**Features** |  |  **Key Dates**  \n\u2751 **Coupon Payment** \u2751 **Issuer Callable** \u2014 Beginning in January 2026, on any Call Date, the issuer may, in its sole discretion, call the Notes in whole, but not in part, and pay you the Stated Principal Amount plus the Coupon Payment otherwise due on such Call Date.

Your decision to purchase the Notes should be made only after carefully considering the risks of an investment in the Notes, including those discussed below, with your advisors in light of your particular circumstances. The Notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about significant elements of the Notes or financial matters in general. You should carefully review the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections beginning on page PS-5 of the accompanying product supplement, page S-__6_ _of the accompanying prospectus supplement and page 7 of the accompanying prospectus identified on page PS-2 above._\n**_Structure-related Risks_**\n\u2666 |  **Your investment may result in a loss; there is no guaranteed return of principal.** There is no fixed principal repayment amount on the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not called prior to maturity and the Final Value of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, at maturity, you will lose 1% of the Stated Principal Amount for each 1% that the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Initial Value. In that case, you will lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The limited downside protection provided by the Downside Threshold applies only at maturity.** You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity. If you are able to sell your Notes in the secondary market prior to a call or maturity, you may have to sell them at a loss relative to your initial investment even if the level of each Underlying at that time is equal to or greater than its Downside Threshold. All payments on the Notes are subject to the credit risk of BofA Finance, as issuer, and BAC, as guarantor.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **Your return on the Notes is limited to the return represented by the Coupon Payments over the term of the Notes.** Your return on the Notes is limited to the Coupon Payments paid over the term of the Notes, regardless of the extent to which the closing level of either Underlying exceeds its Initial Value. Similarly, the amount payable at maturity or upon a call will never exceed the sum of the Stated Principal Amount and the applicable Coupon Payment, regardless of the extent to which the closing level or Final Value, as applicable, of either Underlying exceeds its Initial Value. In contrast, a direct investment in the securities included in one or more of the Underlyings would allow you to receive the benefit of any appreciation in their values. Thus, any return on the Notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned those securities and received the dividends paid or distributions made on them.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The Notes are subject to a potential early call, which would limit your ability to receive the Coupon Payments over the full term of the Notes.** Beginning in January 2026, on each Call Date, at our option, we may redeem your Notes in whole, but not in part. If the Notes are called prior to the Maturity Date, you will be entitled to receive the Stated Principal Amount plus the Coupon Payment otherwise due on such Call Date. In this case, you will lose the opportunity to continue to receive Coupon Payments after the date of the early call. If the Notes are called prior to the Maturity Date, you may be unable to invest in other securities with a similar level of risk that could provide a return that is similar to the Notes. Even if we do not exercise our option to redeem your Notes, our ability to do so may adversely affect the market value of your Notes. It is our sole option whether to redeem your Notes prior to maturity on any Call Date and we may or may not exercise this option for any reason. Because of this, the term of your Notes could be anywhere between three and fifteen months.  \n---|---  \nIt is more likely that we will call the Notes in our sole discretion prior to maturity to the extent that the expected Coupon Payments payable on the Notes are greater than the coupon that would be payable on other instruments issued by us of comparable maturity, terms and credit rating trading in the market. The greater likelihood of us calling the Notes in that environment increases the risk that you will not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the called Notes in another investment that provides a similar yield with a similar level of risk. We are less likely to call the Notes prior to maturity when the expected Coupon Payments payable on the Notes are less than the coupon that would be payable on other comparable instruments issued by us. Therefore, the Notes are more likely to remain outstanding when the expected Coupon Payments payable on the Notes are less than what would be payable on other comparable instruments and when your risk of not receiving a coupon is relatively higher.\n\u2666 |  **Your return on the Notes may be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.** Any return that you receive on the Notes may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased a conventional debt security with the same Maturity Date. As a result, your investment in the Notes may not reflect the full opportunity cost to you when you consider factors, such as inflation, that affect the time value of money. In addition, if interest rates increase during the term of the Notes, the Coupon Payment (if any) may be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **Any payment on the Notes is subject to our credit risk and the credit risk of the Guarantor, and actual or perceived changes in our or the Guarantor\u2019s creditworthiness are expected to affect the value of the Notes.** The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. Any payment on the Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor. The Notes are not guaranteed by any entity other than the Guarantor. As a result, your receipt of all payments on the Notes will be dependent upon our ability and the ability of the Guarantor to repay our respective obligations under the Notes on the applicable payment date, regardless of the closing level or Final Value of either Underlying as compared to its Downside Threshold or Initial Value, as applicable. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition or the financial condition of the Guarantor will be on the Maturity Date. If we and the Guarantor become unable to meet our respective financial obligations as they become due, you may not receive the amounts payable under the terms of the Notes and you could lose all of your initial investment.  \n---|---  \nIn addition, our credit ratings and the credit ratings of the Guarantor are assessments by ratings agencies of our respective abilities to pay our obligations. Consequently, our or the Guarantor\u2019s perceived creditworthiness and actual or anticipated decreases in our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit ratings or increases in the spread between the yield on our respective securities and the yield on U.S. Treasury securities (the \u201ccredit\nPS-7\n* * *\nspread\u201d) prior to the Maturity Date of your Notes may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. However, because your return on the Notes depends upon factors in addition to our ability and the ability of the Guarantor to pay our respective obligations, such as the values of the Underlyings, an improvement in our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit ratings will not reduce the other investment risks related to the Notes.\n\u2666 |  **We are a finance subsidiary and, as such, have no independent assets, operations or revenues.** We are a finance subsidiary of the Guarantor, have no operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of our debt securities that are guaranteed by the Guarantor, and are dependent upon the Guarantor and/or its other subsidiaries to meet our obligations under the Notes in the ordinary course. Therefore, our ability to make payments on the Notes may be limited.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **Because the Notes are linked to the performance of the least performing between the****NDX****and the****RTY****, you are exposed to greater risk of sustaining a significant loss on your investment than if the Notes were linked to just the****NDX****or just the****RTY****.** The risk that you will lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of just the NDX or just the RTY. With two Underlyings, it is more likely that either Underlying will close below its Downside Threshold on the Final Observation Date than if the Notes were linked to only one of the Underlyings, and therefore it is more likely that you will receive a Payment at Maturity that is significantly less than the Stated Principal Amount on the Maturity Date.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **Greater expected volatility generally indicates an increased risk of loss****.** A higher Coupon Rate and/or a lower Downside Threshold may reflect greater expected volatilities of the Underlyings, which is generally associated with a greater risk of loss. Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the levels of the Underlyings over a period of time. The greater the expected volatilities of the Underlyings at the time the terms of the Notes are set, the greater the expectation is at that time that you may lose a significant portion or all of the Stated Principal Amount at maturity. In addition, the economic terms of the Notes, including the Coupon Rate and the Downside Threshold, are based, in part, on the expected volatilities of the Underlyings at the time the terms of the Notes are set, where higher expected volatilities will generally be reflected in a higher Coupon Rate than the fixed rate we would pay on conventional debt securities of the same maturity and/or on otherwise comparable securities and/or a lower Downside Threshold as compared to otherwise comparable securities. Accordingly, a higher Coupon Rate will generally be indicative of a greater risk of loss while a lower Downside Threshold does not necessarily indicate that the Notes have a greater likelihood of returning the Stated Principal Amount at maturity. You should be willing to accept the downside market risk of each Underlying and the potential loss of a significant portion or all of the Stated Principal Amount at maturity.  \n---|---  \n**_Valuation and Market-related Risks_**\n\u2666 |  **The public offering price you pay for the Notes will exceed their initial estimated value.** The range of initial estimated values of the Notes that is provided on the cover page of this preliminary pricing supplement, and the initial estimated value as of the Trade Date that will be provided in the final pricing supplement, are each estimates only, determined as of a particular point in time by reference to our and our affiliates' pricing models. These pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables, including our credit spreads and those of the Guarantor, the Guarantor\u2019s internal funding rate, mid-market terms on hedging transactions, expectations on interest rates, dividends and volatility, price-sensitivity analysis, and the expected term of the Notes. These pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events, which may prove to be incorrect.If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity, their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and lower than their initial estimated value. This is due to, among other things, changes in the level of the Underlyings, changes in the Guarantor\u2019s internal funding rate, and the inclusion in the public offering price of the underwriting discount and the hedging related charges, all as further described in \u201cStructuring the Notes\u201d below. These factors, together with various credit, market and economic factors over the term of the Notes, are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The initial estimated value does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which we,****BAC,****BofAS or any of our other affiliates would be willing to purchase your Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time.** The value of your Notes at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy, including the performance of the Underlyings, our and BAC\u2019s creditworthiness and changes in market conditions.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The price of the Notes that may be paid by BofAS in any secondary market (if BofAS makes a market, which it is not required to do), as well as the price which may be reflected on customer account statements, will be higher than the then-current estimated value of the Notes for a limited time period after the Trade Date.** As agreed by BofAS and UBS, for approximately a three-month period after the Trade Date, to the extent BofAS offers to buy the Notes in the secondary market, it will do so at a price that will exceed the estimated value of the Notes at that time. The amount of this excess, which represents a portion of the hedging-related charges expected to be realized by BofAS and UBS over the term of the Notes, will decline to zero on a straight line basis over that three-month period. Accordingly, the estimated value of your Notes during this initial three-month period may be lower than the value shown on your customer account statements. Thereafter, if BofAS buys or sells your Notes, it will do so at prices that reflect the estimated value determined by reference to its pricing models at that time. Any price at any time after the Trade Date will be based on then-prevailing market conditions and other considerations, including the performance of the Underlyings and the remaining term of the Notes. However, none of us, the Guarantor, BofAS or any other party is obligated to purchase your Notes at any price or at any time, and we cannot assure you that any party will purchase your Notes at a price that equals or exceeds the initial estimated value of the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **We cannot assure you that a trading market for your Notes will ever develop or be maintained.** We will not list the Notes on any securities exchange. We cannot predict how the Notes will trade in any secondary market or whether that market will be liquid or illiquid.  \n---|---  \nThe development of a trading market for the Notes will depend on the Guarantor\u2019s financial performance and other factors, including changes in the level of the Underlyings. The number of potential buyers of your Notes in any secondary market may be limited. We anticipate that BofAS\nPS-8\n* * *\nwill act as a market-maker for the Notes, but none of us, the Guarantor or BofAS is required to do so. There is no assurance that any party will be willing to purchase your Notes at any price in any secondary market. BofAS may discontinue its market-making activities as to the Notes at any time. To the extent that BofAS engages in any market-making activities, it may bid for or offer the Notes. Any price at which BofAS may bid for, offer, purchase, or sell any Notes may differ from the values determined by pricing models that it may use, whether as a result of dealer discounts, mark-ups, or other transaction costs. These bids, offers, or completed transactions may affect the prices, if any, at which the Notes might otherwise trade in the market. In addition, if at any time BofAS were to cease acting as a market-maker as to the Notes, it is likely that there would be significantly less liquidity in the secondary market. In such a case, the price at which the Notes could be sold likely would be lower than if an active market existed.\n\u2666 |  **Economic and market factors have affected the terms of the Notes and may affect the market value of the Notes prior to maturity or a call.** Because market-linked notes, including the Notes, can be thought of as having a debt component and a derivative component, factors that influence the values of debt instruments and options and other derivatives will also affect the terms and features of the Notes at issuance and the market price of the Notes prior to maturity or a call. These factors include the levels of the Underlyings and the securities included in the Underlyings; the volatility of the Underlyings and the securities included in the Underlyings; the correlation among the Underlyings; the dividend rate paid on the securities included in the Underlyings, if applicable; the time remaining to the maturity of the Notes; interest rates in the markets; geopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, force majeure and regulatory or judicial events; the availability of comparable instruments; the creditworthiness of BofA Finance, as issuer, and BAC, as guarantor; and the then current bid-ask spread for the Notes and the factors discussed under \u201c\u2014 Trading and hedging activities by us, the Guarantor and any of our other affiliates,including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates, may create conflicts of interest with you and may affect your return on the Notes and their market value\u201d below. These factors are unpredictable and interrelated and may offset or magnify each other.  \n---|---  \n**_Conflict-related_**** _R_**** _isks_**\n\u2666 |  **Trading and hedging activities by us, the Guarantor and any of our other affiliates,****including BofAS,****and UBS and its affiliates, may create conflicts of interest with you and may affect your return on the Notes and their market value.** We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates, may buy or sell the securities held by or included in the Underlyings, or futures or options contracts on the Underlyings or those securities, or other listed or over-the-counter derivative instruments linked to the Underlyings or those securities. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates also may issue or underwrite other financial instruments with returns based upon the Underlyings. We expect to enter into arrangements or adjust or close out existing transactions to hedge our obligations under the Notes. We, the Guarantor or our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates also may enter into hedging transactions relating to other notes or instruments, some of which may have returns calculated in a manner related to that of the Notes offered hereby. We or UBS may enter into such hedging arrangements with one of our or their affiliates. Our affiliates or their affiliates may enter into additional hedging transactions with other parties relating to the Notes and the Underlyings. This hedging activity is expected to result in a profit to those engaging in the hedging activity, which could be more or less than initially expected, or the hedging activity could also result in a loss. We and our affiliates and UBS and its affiliates will price these hedging transactions with the intent to realize a profit, regardless of whether the value of the Notes increases or decreases. Any profit in connection with such hedging activities will be in addition to any other compensation that we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates receive for the sale of the Notes, which creates an additional incentive to sell the Notes to you. While we, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates may from time to time own securities represented by the Underlyings, except to the extent that BAC\u2019s or UBS Group AG\u2019s (the parent company of UBS) common stock may be included in the Underlyings, as applicable, we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates do not control any company included in the Underlyings, and have not verified any disclosure made by any other company. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates may execute such purchases or sales for our own or their own accounts, for business reasons, or in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes. The transactions described above may present a conflict of interest between your interest in the Notes and the interests we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates may have in our or their proprietary accounts, in facilitating transactions, including block trades, for our or their other customers, and in accounts under our or their management.  \n---|---  \nThe transactions described above may affect the value of the Underlyings in a manner that could be adverse to your investment in the Notes. On or before the Strike Date, any purchases or sales by us, the Guarantor or our other affiliates, including BofAS or others on its behalf, and UBS and its affiliates (including for the purpose of hedging some or all of our anticipated exposure in connection with the Notes) may have affected the value of the Underlyings. Consequently, the value of the Underlyings may change subsequent to the Strike Date, which may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. In addition, these activities may decrease the market value of your Notes prior to maturity, and may affect the amounts to be paid on the Notes. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, and UBS and its affiliates may purchase or otherwise acquire a long or short position in the Notes and may hold or resell the Notes. For example, BofAS may enter into these transactions in connection with any market making activities in which it engages. We cannot assure you that these activities will not adversely affect the value of the Underlyings, the market value of your Notes prior to maturity or the amounts payable on the Notes.\n\u2666 |  **There may be potential conflicts of interest involving the calculation agent, which is an affiliate of ours.** We have the right to appoint and remove the calculation agent. One of our affiliates will be the calculation agent for the Notes and, as such, will make a variety of determinations relating to the Notes, including the amounts that will be paid on the Notes. Under some circumstances, these duties could result in a conflict of interest between its status as our affiliate and its responsibilities as calculation agent.  \n---|---  \nPS-9\n* * *\n**_Underlying-related Risks_**\n\u2666 |  **The Notes are subject to the market risk of the Underlyings.** The return on the Notes, which may be negative, is directly linked to the performance of the Underlyings and indirectly linked to the value of the securities included in the Underlyings. The levels of the Underlyings can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the Underlyings and the securities included in the Underlyings and the issuers of such securities, such as stock price volatility, earnings and financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market or commodity market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The Notes are subject to risks associated with foreign securities markets.** The NDX includes certain foreign equity securities. You should be aware that investments in securities linked to the value of foreign equity securities involve particular risks. The foreign securities markets comprising the NDX may have less liquidity and may be more volatile than U.S. or other securities markets and market developments may affect foreign markets differently from U.S. or other securities markets. Direct or indirect government intervention to stabilize these foreign securities markets, as well as cross-shareholdings in foreign companies, may affect trading prices and volumes in these markets. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies than about those U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and foreign companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements that differ from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. Prices of securities in foreign countries are subject to political, economic, financial and social factors that apply in those geographical regions. These factors, which could negatively affect those securities markets, include the possibility of recent or future changes in a foreign government\u2019s economic and fiscal policies, the possible imposition of, or changes in, currency exchange laws or other laws or restrictions applicable to foreign companies or investments in foreign equity securities and the possibility of fluctuations in the rate of exchange between currencies, the possibility of outbreaks of hostility and political instability and the possibility of natural disaster or adverse public health developments in the region. Moreover, foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in important respects such as growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resources and self-sufficiency.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **Governmental regulatory actions could result in material changes to the composition of the NDX and could negatively affect your return on the Notes.** Governmental regulatory actions, including but not limited to sanctions-related actions by the U.S. or foreign governments, could make it necessary or advisable for there to be material changes to the composition of the NDX, depending on the nature of such governmental regulatory actions and the constituent stocks that are affected. For instance, pursuant to recent executive orders, U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions in publicly traded securities of certain companies that are determined to be linked to the People\u2019s Republic of China (the \u201cPRC\u201d) military, intelligence and security apparatus, or securities that are derivative of, or are designed to provide investment exposure to such securities. If any governmental regulatory action results in the removal of constituent stocks that have (or historically have had) significant weights within the NDX, such removal, or even any uncertainty relating to a possible removal, could have a material and negative effect on the price of the NDX and, therefore, your return on the Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The publisher of an Underlying may adjust that Underlying in a way that affects its levels, and the publisher has no obligation to consider your interests.** The publisher of an Underlying can add, delete, or substitute the components included in that Underlying or make other methodological changes that could change its level. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of your Notes.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **You are exposed to the market risk of both Underlyings.** Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Underlyings. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each of the NDX and the RTY. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets, in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all of the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to both the NDX and the RTY. Poor performance by either of the Underlyings over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by positive performance by the other Underlying. To receive the contingent repayment of principal at maturity, each Underlying must close at or above its Downside Threshold on the Final Observation Date. Therefore, if the Notes are not called prior to maturity, you may incur a loss proportionate to the negative return of the Least Performing Underlying even if the other Underlying appreciates during the term of the Notes. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of both Underlyings. Additionally, movements in the values of the Underlyings may be correlated or uncorrelated at different times during the term of the Notes, and such correlation (or lack thereof) could have an adverse effect on your return on the Notes. For example, the likelihood that one of the Underlyings will close below its Downside Threshold on the Final Observation Date will increase when the movements in the values of the Underlyings are uncorrelated. Thus, if the performance of the Underlyings is not correlated or is negatively correlated, the risk of incurring a significant loss of principal at maturity is greater. In addition, correlation generally decreases for each additional Underlying to which the Notes are linked, resulting in a greater potential for a significant loss of principal at maturity. Although the correlation of the Underlyings\u2019 performance may change over the term of the Notes, the economic terms of the Notes, including the Coupon Rate and Downside Thresholds, are determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Underlyings\u2019 performance calculated using our and our affiliates' pricing models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. All other things being equal, a higher Coupon Rate and lower Downside Threshold is generally associated with lower correlation of the Underlyings, which may indicate a greater potential for a significant loss on your investment at maturity. See \u201cCorrelation of the Underlyings\u201d below.  \n---|---  \n\u2666 |  **The Notes are subject to risks associated with small-size capitalization companies.** The stocks comprising the RTY are issued by companies with small-sized market capitalization. The stock prices of small-size companies may be more volatile than stock prices of large capitalization companies. Small-size capitalization companies may be less able to withstand adverse economic, market, trade and competitive conditions relative to larger companies. Small-size capitalization companies may also be more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products or services.  \n---|---  \nPS-10\n* * *\n**_Tax-related Risks_**\n\u2666 |  **The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, and may be adverse to a holder of the Notes.** No statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the Notes or securities substantially similar to the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are not certain. Under the terms of the Notes, you will have agreed with us to treat the Notes as consisting of a put option and a deposit, as more fully described below under \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Summary\u2014General.\u201d If the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) were successful in asserting an alternative characterization for the Notes, the timing and character of income, gain or loss with respect to the Notes may differ. No ruling will be requested from the IRS with respect to the Notes and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the statements made in the section entitled \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Summary.\u201d**You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of investing in the Notes.**  \n---|---  \nPS-11\n* * *\n**Hypothetical Examples**  \n---  \n**Hypothetical terms only.

The information reflects the policies of, and is subject to change by each of Nasdaq, Inc., the sponsor of the NDX, and FTSE Russell, the sponsor of the RTY. We refer to Nasdaq, Inc. and FTSE Russell as the \u201cUnderlying Sponsors.\u201d The Underlying Sponsors, which license the copyright and all other rights to the Underlyings, have no obligation to continue to publish, and may discontinue publication of, the Underlyings. The consequences of either Underlying Sponsor discontinuing publication of the applicable Underlying are discussed in \u201cDescription of the Notes\u2014Discontinuance of an Index\u201d in the accompanying product supplement. None of us, the Guarantor, the calculation agent, or either Selling Agent accepts any responsibility for the calculation, maintenance or publication of either Underlying or any successor index.\nNone of us, the Guarantor, the Selling Agents or any of our or their respective affiliates makes any representation to you as to the future performance of the Underlyings.\nYou should make your own investigation into the Underlyings.\n**The****Nasdaq-100****\u00ae****Index**\nThe NDX is intended to measure the performance of the 100 largest domestic and international non-financial securities listed on NASDAQ based on market capitalization. The NDX reflects companies across major industry groups including computer hardware and software, telecommunications, retail/wholesale trade and biotechnology. It does not contain securities of financial companies including investment companies.\nThe NDX began trading on January 31, 1985 at a base value of 125.00. The NDX is calculated and published by Nasdaq, Inc. In administering the NDX, Nasdaq, Inc. will exercise reasonable discretion as it deems appropriate.\n_Underlying Stock Eligibility Criteria_\nNDX eligibility is limited to specific security types only. The security types eligible for the NDX include foreign or domestic common stocks, ordinary shares, ADRs and tracking stocks. Security types not included in the NDX are closed-end funds, convertible debt securities, exchange traded funds, limited liability companies, limited partnership interests, preferred stocks, rights, shares or units of beneficial interest, warrants, units, and other derivative securities. The NDX does not contain securities of investment companies. For purposes of the NDX eligibility criteria, if the security is a depositary receipt representing a security of a non-U.S. issuer, then references to the \u201cissuer\u201d are references to the issuer of the underlying security.\n_Initial Eligibility Criteria_\nTo be eligible for initial inclusion in the NDX, a security must be listed on NASDAQ and meet the following criteria:\nthe security\u2019s U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market (unless the security was dually listed on another U.S. market prior to January 1, 2004 and has continuously maintained such listing);\n\u25cf |  the security must be of a non-financial company;  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy proceedings;  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  the security must have a minimum three-month average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares;  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  if the issuer of the security is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the U.S., then such security must have listed options on a recognized options market in the U.S. or be eligible for listed-options trading on a recognized options market in the U.S.;  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  the issuer of the security may not have entered into a definitive agreement or other arrangement which would likely result in the security no longer being eligible for inclusion in the NDX;  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements with an audit opinion that is currently withdrawn; and  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  the issuer of the security must have \u201cseasoned\u201d on NASDAQ, NYSE or NYSE Amex. Generally, a company is considered to be seasoned if it has been listed on a market for at least three full months (excluding the first month of initial listing).  \n---|---  \n_Continued Eligibility Criteria_\nIn addition, to be eligible for continued inclusion in the NDX, the following criteria apply:\n\u25cf |  the security\u2019s U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market;  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  the security must be of a non-financial company;  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy proceedings;  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  the security must have a minimum three-month average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares;  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  if the issuer of the security is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the U.S., then such security must have listed options on a recognized options market in the U.S. or be eligible for listed-options trading on a recognized options market in the U.S. (measured annually during the ranking review process);  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  the security must have an adjusted market capitalization equal to or exceeding 0.10% of the aggregate adjusted market capitalization of the NDX at each month-end. In the event a company does not meet this criterion for two consecutive month-ends, it will be removed from the NDX effective after the close of trading on the third Friday of the following month; and  \n---|---  \n\u25cf |  the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements with an audit opinion that is currently withdrawn.  \n---|---  \n_Computation of the NDX_\nThe value of the NDX equals the aggregate value of the NDX share weights (the \u201cNDX Shares\u201d) of each of the NDX securities multiplied by each such security\u2019s last sale price (last sale price refers to the last sale price on NASDAQ), and divided by the divisor of the NDX. If trading in an NDX security is\nPS-14\n* * *\nhalted while the market is open, the last traded price for that security is used for all NDX computations until trading resumes. If trading is halted before the market is open, the previous day\u2019s last sale price is used. The formula for determining the NDX value is as follows:\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017607/image_003.jpg)\nThe NDX is ordinarily calculated without regard to cash dividends on NDX securities. The NDX is calculated during the trading day and is disseminated once per second from 09:30:01 to 17:16:00 ET. The closing level of the NDX may change up until 17:15:00 ET due to corrections to the last sale price of the NDX securities. The official closing value of the NDX is ordinarily disseminated at 17:16:00 ET.\n_NDX Maintenance_\n_Changes to NDX Constituents_\nChanges to the NDX constituents may be made during the annual ranking review. In addition, if at any time during the year other than the annual review, it is determined that an NDX security issuer no longer meets the criteria for continued inclusion in the NDX, or is otherwise determined to have become ineligible for continued inclusion in the NDX, it is replaced with the largest market capitalization issuer not currently in the NDX that meets the applicable eligibility criteria for initial inclusion in the NDX.\nOrdinarily, a security will be removed from the NDX at its last sale price. However, if at the time of its removal the NDX security is halted from trading on its primary listing market and an official closing price cannot readily be determined, the NDX security may, in Nasdaq, Inc.\u2019s discretion, be removed at a price of $0.00000001 (\u201czero price\u201d). This zero price will be applied to the NDX security after the close of the market but prior to the time the official closing value of the NDX is disseminated.\n_Divisor Adjustments_\nThe divisor is adjusted to ensure that changes in the NDX constituents either by corporate actions (that adjust either the price or shares of an NDX security) or NDX participation outside of trading hours do not affect the value of the NDX. All divisor changes occur after the close of the applicable index security markets.\n_Quarterly NDX Rebalancing_\nThe NDX will be rebalanced on a quarterly basis if it is determined that (1) the current weight of the single NDX security with the largest market capitalization is greater than 24.0% of the NDX or (2) the collective weight of those securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5% exceeds 48.0% of the NDX. In addition, a \u201cspecial rebalancing\u201d of the NDX may be conducted at any time if Nasdaq, Inc. determines it necessary to maintain the integrity and continuity of the NDX. If either one or both of the above weight distribution conditions are met upon quarterly review, or Nasdaq, Inc. determines that a special rebalancing is necessary, a weight rebalancing will be performed.\nIf the first weight distribution condition is met and the current weight of the single NDX security with the largest market capitalization is greater than 24.0%, then the weights of all securities with current weights greater than 1.0% (\u201clarge securities\u201d) will be scaled down proportionately toward 1.0% until the adjusted weight of the single largest NDX security reaches 20.0%.\nIf the second weight distribution condition is met and the collective weight of those securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5% (or adjusted weights in accordance with the previous step, if applicable) exceeds 48.0% of the NDX, then the weights of all such large securities in that group will be scaled down proportionately toward 1.0% until their collective weight, so adjusted, is equal to 40.0%.\nThe aggregate weight reduction among the large securities resulting from either or both of the rebalancing steps above will then be redistributed to those securities with weightings of less than 1.0% (\u201csmall securities\u201d) in the following manner. In the first iteration, the weight of the largest small security will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal to the average NDX weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller remaining small securities will be scaled up by the same factor reduced in relation to each security\u2019s relative ranking among the small securities such that the smaller the NDX security in the ranking, the less its weight will be scaled upward. This is intended to reduce the market impact of the weight rebalancing on the smallest component securities in the NDX.\nIn the second iteration of the small security rebalancing, the weight of the second largest small security, already adjusted in the first iteration, will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal to the average NDX weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller remaining small securities will be scaled up by this same factor reduced in relation to each security\u2019s relative ranking among the small securities such that, once again, the smaller the security in the ranking, the less its weight will be scaled upward. Additional iterations will be performed until the accumulated increase in weight among the small securities equals the aggregate weight reduction among the large securities that resulted from the rebalancing in accordance with the two weight distribution conditions discussed above.\nFinally, to complete the rebalancing process, once the final weighting percentages for each NDX security have been set, the NDX Shares will be determined anew based upon the last sale prices and aggregate capitalization of the NDX at the close of trading on the last calendar day in February, May, August and November. Changes to the NDX Shares will be made effective after the close of trading on the third Friday in March, June, September and December, and an adjustment to the divisor is made to ensure continuity of the NDX. Ordinarily, new rebalanced NDX Shares will be determined by applying the above procedures to the current NDX Shares. However, Nasdaq, Inc. may, from time to time, determine rebalanced\nPS-15\n* * *\nweights, if necessary, by applying the above procedure to the actual current market capitalization of the NDX components. In such instances, Nasdaq, Inc. would announce the different basis for rebalancing prior to its implementation.\nDuring the quarterly rebalancing, data is cutoff as of the previous month end and no changes are made to the NDX from that cutoff until the quarterly index share change effective date, except in the case of changes due to corporate actions with an ex-date.\n_Adjustments for Corporate Actions_\nChanges in the price and/or NDX Shares driven by corporate events such as stock dividends, splits, and certain spin-offs and rights issuances will be adjusted on the ex-date. If the change in total shares outstanding arising from other corporate actions is greater than or equal to 10.0%, the change will be made as soon as practicable. Otherwise, if the change in total shares outstanding is less than 10.0%, then all such changes are accumulated and made effective at one time on a quarterly basis after the close of trading on the third Friday in each of March, June, September, and December. The NDX Shares are derived from the security\u2019s total shares outstanding. The NDX Shares are adjusted by the same percentage amount by which the total shares outstanding have changed.\n_Historical Performance of the NDX_\nThe following graph sets forth the daily historical performance of the NDX in the period from January 2, 2020 through the Strike Date. We obtained this historical data from Bloomberg L.P. We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information obtained from Bloomberg L.P. The horizontal line in the graph represents the NDX\u2019s Downside Threshold of 17,260.07 (rounded to two decimal places), which is 70% of the NDX\u2019s Initial Value of 24,657.24, which was the NDX\u2019s closing level on the Strike Date.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017607/image_004.jpg)\nThis historical data on the NDX is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of the NDX or what the value of the Notes may be.

Additional information on the RTY is available at the following website: http://www.ftserussell.com. No information on that website is deemed to be included or incorporated by reference in this pricing supplement.\nRussell began dissemination of the RTY on January 1, 1984. FTSE Russell calculates and publishes the RTY. The RTY was set to 135 as of the close of business on December 31, 1986. The RTY is designed to track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. As a subset of the Russell 3000\u00ae Index, the RTY consists of the smallest 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000\u00ae Index. The Russell 3000\u00ae Index measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies, representing approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market. The RTY is determined, comprised, and calculated by FTSE Russell without regard to the Notes.\n_Selection of Stocks Comprising the RTY_\nAll companies eligible for inclusion in the RTY must be classified as a U.S. company under FTSE Russell\u2019s country-assignment methodology. If a company is incorporated, has a stated headquarters location, and trades in the same country (American Depositary Receipts and American Depositary Shares are not eligible), then the company is assigned to its country of incorporation. If any of the three factors are not the same, FTSE Russell defines three Home Country Indicators (\u201cHCIs\u201d): country of incorporation, country of headquarters, and country of the most liquid exchange (as defined by a two-year average daily dollar trading volume) from all exchanges within a country. Using the HCIs, FTSE Russell compares the primary location of the company\u2019s assets with the three HCIs. If the primary location of its assets matches any of the HCIs, then the company is assigned to the primary location of its assets. If there is insufficient information to determine the country in which the company\u2019s assets are primarily located, FTSE Russell will use the country from which the company\u2019s revenues are primarily derived for the comparison with the three HCIs in a similar manner. FTSE Russell uses the average of two years of assets or revenues data to reduce potential turnover. If conclusive country details cannot be derived from assets or revenues data, FTSE Russell will assign the company to the country of its headquarters, which is defined as the address of the company\u2019s principal executive offices, unless that country is a Benefit Driven Incorporation (\u201cBDI\u201d) country, in which case the company will be assigned to the country of its most liquid stock exchange. BDI countries include: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Bonaire, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cook Islands, Curacao, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Liberia, Marshall Islands, Panama, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Turks and Caicos Islands. For any companies incorporated or headquartered in a U.S. territory, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. HCI is assigned.\nAll securities eligible for inclusion in the RTY must trade on a major U.S. exchange. Stocks must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on their primary exchange on the last trading day in May to be eligible for inclusion during annual reconstitution. However, in order to reduce unnecessary turnover, if an existing member\u2019s closing price is less than $1.00 on the last day of May, it will be considered eligible if the average of the daily closing prices (from its primary exchange) during the month of May is equal to or greater than $1.00. Initial public offerings are added each quarter and must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on the last day of their eligibility period in order to qualify for index inclusion. If an existing stock does not trade on the \u201crank day\u201d (typically the last trading day in May but a confirmed timetable is announced each spring) but does have a closing price at or above $1.00 on another eligible U.S. exchange, that stock will be eligible for inclusion.\nAn important criterion used to determine the list of securities eligible for the RTY is total market capitalization, which is defined as the market price as of the last trading day in May for those securities being considered at annual reconstitution times the total number of shares outstanding. Where applicable, common stock, non-restricted exchangeable shares and partnership units/membership interests are used to determine market capitalization. Any other form of shares such as preferred stock, convertible preferred stock, redeemable shares, participating preferred stock, warrants and rights, installment receipts or trust receipts, are excluded from the calculation. If multiple share classes of common stock exist, they are combined. In cases where the common stock share classes act independently of each other (e.g., tracking stocks), each class is considered for inclusion separately. If multiple share classes exist, the pricing vehicle will be designated as the share class with the highest two-year trading volume as of the rank day in May.\nCompanies with a total market capitalization of less than $30 million are not eligible for the RTY. Similarly, companies with only 5% or less of their shares available in the marketplace are not eligible for the RTY. Royalty trusts, limited liability companies, closed-end investment companies (companies that are required to report Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, as defined by the SEC, including business development companies), blank check companies, special purpose acquisition companies, and limited partnerships are also ineligible for inclusion. Bulletin board, pink sheets, and over-the-counter traded securities are not eligible for inclusion. Exchange traded funds and mutual funds are also excluded.\nAnnual reconstitution is a process by which the RTY is completely rebuilt. Based on closing levels of the company\u2019s common stock on its primary exchange on the rank day of May of each year, FTSE Russell reconstitutes the composition of the RTY using the then existing market capitalizations of eligible companies. Reconstitution of the RTY occurs on the last Friday in June or, when the last Friday in June is the 29th or 30th, reconstitution occurs on the prior Friday. In addition, FTSE Russell adds initial public offerings to the RTY on a quarterly basis based on total market capitalization ranking within the market-adjusted capitalization breaks established during the most recent reconstitution. After membership is determined, a security\u2019s shares are adjusted to include only those shares available to the public. This is often referred to as \u201cfree float.\u201d The purpose of the adjustment is to exclude from market calculations the capitalization that is not available for purchase and is not part of the investable opportunity set.\nPS-17\n* * *\n_Historical Performance of the_ _RTY_\nThe following graph sets forth the daily historical performance of the RTY in the period from January 2, 2020 through the Strike Date. We obtained this historical data from Bloomberg L.P. We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information obtained from Bloomberg L.P. The horizontal line in the graph represents the RTY\u2019s Downside Threshold of 1,726.911 (rounded to three decimal places), which is 70% of the RTY\u2019s Initial Value of 2,467.015, which was the RTY\u2019s closing level on the Strike Date.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017607/image_005.jpg)\nThis historical data on the RTY is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of the RTY or what the value of the Notes may be.

For comparison purposes, each Underlying has been \u201cnormalized\u201d to have a closing level of 100 on January 2, 2020 by dividing the closing level of that Underlying on each trading day by the closing level of that Underlying on January 2, 2020 and multiplying by 100. We obtained the closing levels used to determine the normalized closing levels set forth below from Bloomberg L.P., without independent verification.\nThe correlation of a pair of Underlyings represents a statistical measurement of the degree to which the returns of those Underlyings were similar to each other over a given period in terms of timing and direction. The correlation between a pair of Underlyings is scaled from 1.0 to -1.0, with 1.0 indicating perfect positive correlation (_i.e._ , the value of both Underlyings are increasing together or decreasing together and the ratio of their returns has been constant), 0 indicating no correlation (_i.e._ , there is no statistical relationship between the returns of that pair of Underlyings) and -1.0 indicating perfect negative correlation (_i.e._ , as the value of one Underlying increases, the value of the other Underlying decreases and the ratio of their returns has been constant).\nThe graph below illustrates the historical performance of each Underlying relative to each other over the time period shown and provides an indication of how close the relative performance of each Underlying has historically been to the other Underlying. A closer relationship between the daily returns of two or more underlying assets over a given period indicates that such underlying assets have been more positively correlated. Lower (or more-negative) correlation among two or more underlying assets over a given period may indicate that it is less likely that those underlying assets will subsequently move in the same direction. Therefore, lower correlation among the Underlyings may indicate a greater potential for one of the Underlyings to close below its Downside Threshold on the Final Observation Date, because there may be a greater likelihood that at least one of the Underlyings will decrease in value significantly. However, even if the Underlyings have a higher positive correlation, one or both of the Underlyings may close below the respective Downside Threshold(s) on the Final Observation Date, as the Underlyings may both decrease in value. Moreover, the actual correlation among the Underlyings may differ, perhaps significantly, from their historical correlation. Although the correlation of the Underlyings\u2019 performance may change over the term of the Notes, the economic terms of the Notes, including the Coupon Rate and Downside Threshold are determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Underlyings\u2019 performance calculated using our and our affiliates' pricing models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. All other things being equal, a higher Coupon Rate and lower Downside Threshold is generally associated with lower correlation among the Underlyings, which may indicate a greater potential for a significant loss on your investment at maturity. See \u201cYou are exposed to the market risk of both Underlyings\u201d, \u201cBecause the Notes are linked to the performance of the least performing between the NDX and the RTY, you are exposed to greater risk of sustaining a significant loss on your investment than if the Notes were linked to just the NDX or just the RTY\u201d and \u201cGreater expected volatility generally indicates an increased risk of loss\u201d in the Risk Factors section herein.\nPast performance and correlation of the Underlyings are not indicative of the future performance or correlation of the Underlyings.\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000191870425017607/image_006.jpg)\nPS-20\n* * *\n**Supplement to the Plan of Distribution; Role of BofAS and Conflicts of Interest**  \n---  \nBofAS, an affiliate of BofA Finance and the lead selling agent for the sale of the Notes, will receive an underwriting discount of $0.10 for any Note sold in this offering. UBS, as selling agent for sales of the Notes, expects to purchase from BofAS, and BofAS expects to sell to UBS, all of the Notes sold in this offering for $9.90 per Note. UBS proposes to offer the Notes to the public at a price of $10.00 per Note. UBS will receive an underwriting discount of $0.10 for each Note it sells to the public. The underwriting discount will be received by UBS and its financial advisors collectively. If all of the Notes are not sold at the initial offering price, BofAS may change the public offering price and other selling terms.\nBofAS, a broker-dealer affiliate of ours, is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u201cFINRA\u201d) and will participate as lead selling agent in the distribution of the Notes. Accordingly, the offering of the Notes will conform to the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121. BofAS may not make sales in this offering to any of its discretionary accounts without the prior written approval of the account holder.\nWe will deliver the Notes against payment therefor in New York, New York on a date that is greater than one business day following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.

Excluding severance and other costs related to the transaction, Hess-related impacts on the Company\u2019s adjusted earnings in third quarter 2025 are estimated to be $50 to $150 million. Additional details are provided in the table below:\n  \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| Unit | 3Q 2025  \nOutlook | Comments  \nAdjusted earnings (loss), after-tax1 | $ MM | $50 - 150 | After-tax loss of $(200)-(400), adjusted to exclude severance and other transaction costs of $(350)-(450)  \nDepreciation, depletion and amortization, pre-tax | $ B | $1.2 - 1.4 | Legacy Hess & purchase price allocation impacts  \nNet oil-equivalent production2 | MBOED | 450 - 500 | Includes downtime  \nCapital expenditures | $ B | $1.0 - 1.25 |   \nProceeds and deposits related to asset sales | $ MM | $410 | Malaysia/Thailand JDA asset sale  \n|  |  |   \n1 Non-GAAP financial measure as defined below.  \n2 Excludes volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts in the Bakken.  \nOther Guidance:\nThe Company expects to realize synergies from the Hess transaction in future quarterly earnings. Approximately half of the cash outflows associated with the severance and other transaction costs related to the Hess acquisition are expected to occur in third quarter 2025, and the remainder is expected within the next 12 months. Overall, the Company expects a working capital outflow of $0.5 to $1.5 billion in third quarter 2025.\nIn addition, the Company expects to have approximately 2 billion shares of common stock outstanding at September 30, 2025, and approximately 1.95 billion weighted average shares outstanding during third quarter 2025.\nThe preliminary financial information presented is an estimate based on information available to management as of the date of this filing and has not been reviewed by the Company\u2019s independent registered accounting firm. The preliminary financial information presented is not to be considered comprehensive of all items that could impact Chevron\u2019s financial results for the quarter, which will be reported on or around October 31, 2025, and is subject to adjustments or changes pending the finalization of the Company\u2019s financial reporting process. It is possible that the financial impact of these items may differ from the estimates provided, including differences due to final accounting determinations, changes in facts, circumstances or assumptions or other developments in the interim.

Any extractive payments in the Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products business segments have been captured. As required by the Regulations, payments included in this Report are on a cash (rather than accrual) basis, based on the year in which the payment was made.\n  \n\nThe payments reported follow Form SD\u2019s instructions but do not equal our ultimate liabilities (e.g., production entitlements, taxes, and royalties) for the reporting year. Notably, the Report only covers extractive payments and, in most cases, fails to include payments made to governments related to our other business segments. Additionally, the Report is limited to payments we control and excludes ExxonMobil\u2019s share of significant payments made to governments by other parties (e.g., equity companies). More specifically, the tax payments reported in this document do not equal our ultimate tax liability. They are the payments we made to the governments in the reporting year reduced by the amount of any refunds and do not include amounts for the purchase of tax credits. For these reasons, we believe the total global taxes and duties expense listed in the companies\u2019 publicly available financial statements provide a more accurate reflection of the full scope of contributions made to governments.\n  \n\nPlease note: this Report only covers the payments required to be disclosed under the Regulations. This does not reflect the full scope of ExxonMobil\u2019s global economic contributions from the capital we invest annually (>$25 billion in 2024) or the taxes, fees, and duties paid to local, state, and federal governments, which is far greater than what is reflected in this report:\n  \n\n\u2022In 2024, as reflected in the companies' financial statements, ExxonMobil earnings totaled nearly $35 billion.\n  \n\n\u2022Global tax and duties expense in 2024 was $44 billion.\n\u25e6This includes more than $13 billion in income taxes.\n\u25e6Based on 2024 Form 10-K's, ExxonMobil was the 5th highest cash tax payor of worldwide income taxes in the Fortune 25 U.S. companies. Our 2024 worldwide effective income tax rate was 33% (excluding acquired entities).\n  \n\n\u2022In the United States specifically, ExxonMobil's total expense for taxes and duties in 2024 was more than $9 billion.\n\u25e6$9 billion is more than six times higher than the U.S. taxes shown in this Report. \n  \n\nThe narrow focus of this report makes it challenging to draw meaningful comparisons of payments across countries. Payments to different governments vary due to factors like resource type, project start-up timing, whether payments are controlled by ExxonMobil or third parties, and whether third parties or partners are considered government entities. Payments can also vary dramatically depending on the age of the field and the related pace and amount of resource depletion. Fiscal terms are always subject to negotiation and are reflective of the relative risk and upfront investment required. \n  \n\nThe payment disclosure required by Form SD is included as an exhibit to this Form. Payments are reported in U.S. Dollars and are shown in this Report rounded to the nearest $0.1 million. Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated. If payments are made in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, those payments are translated using the exchange rate at the time of payment.\n  \n\nExxonMobil is leveraging the delayed reporting provision of Item 2.01 pertaining to payments related to exploratory activities. These payments will be disclosed in the Form SD submission for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025.\n  \n\n2\n* * *\n  \n\nExxonMobil is relying on the alternative reporting provision of Item 2.01.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  \nNote 1. Basis of Financial Statement Preparation\nThese unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\nRestricted cash represents sale proceeds required to be set aside by a contractual arrangement for any potential like-kind exchange. The restriction will lapse upon the earlier of completion of the exchange or the expiry of the underlying time period, which is less than one year.\nThe Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the \"successful efforts\" method.\n  \n\nNote 2. Pioneer Natural Resources Merger\nOn May 3, 2024, the Corporation acquired Pioneer Natural Resources Company (\"Pioneer\"), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. In connection with the acquisition, we issued 545 million shares of ExxonMobil common stock having a fair value of $63 billion on the acquisition date, and assumed debt with a fair value of $5 billion.\nThe transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n  \n\n|  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n(billions of dollars) | Pioneer  \nCurrent assets (1) | 3 |   \nOther non-current assets | 1 |   \nProperty, plant & equipment (2) | 84 |   \nTotal identifiable assets acquired | 88 |   \n|   \nCurrent liabilities (1) | 3 |   \nLong-term debt (3) | 5 |   \nDeferred income tax liabilities (4) | 16 |   \nOther non-current liabilities | 2 |   \nTotal liabilities assumed | 26 |   \nNet identifiable assets acquired | 62 |   \n|   \nGoodwill (5) | 1 |   \nNet assets | 63 |   \n|   \n(1) Current assets and current liabilities consist primarily of accounts receivable and payable, with their respective fair values approximating historical values given their short-term duration, expectation of insignificant bad debt expense, and our credit rating.  \n(2) Property, plant and equipment, of which a significant portion relates to crude oil and natural gas properties, was primarily valued using the income approach. Significant inputs and assumptions used in the income approach included estimates for commodity prices, future oil and gas production volumes, drilling and development costs, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Collectively, these inputs are level 3 inputs.  \n(3) Long-term debt was valued using market prices as of the acquisition date, which reflects the use of level 1 inputs.  \n(4) Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences in the tax basis and acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  \n(5) Goodwill was allocated to the Upstream segment.  \n  \n\n9\n* * *\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408825000042/xom-20250630.htm#i3fa947d5ca3846dca30fa994179f4ef9_7)\nDebt Assumed in the Merger\nThe following table presents long-term debt assumed at closing:\n  \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n(millions of dollars) | Par Value | Fair Value  \nas of May 2, 2024  \n0.250% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2025 (1) | 450 |  | 1,327 |   \n1.125% Senior Notes due January 2026 | 750 |  | 699 |   \n5.100% Senior Notes due March 2026 | 1,100 |  | 1,096 |   \n7.200% Senior Notes due January 2028 | 241 |  | 252 |   \n4.125% Senior Notes due February 2028 | 138 |  | 130 |   \n1.900% Senior Notes due August 2030 | 1,100 |  | 914 |   \n2.150% Senior Notes due January 2031 | 1,000 |  | 832 |   \n(1) In June 2024, the Corporation redeemed in full all of the Convertible Senior Notes assumed from Pioneer for an amount consistent with the acquisition date fair value.  \n  \n\nActual and Pro Forma Impact of Merger\nThe following table presents revenues and earnings included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for Pioneer since the acquisition date (May 3, 2024) through June 30, 2024:\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n(millions of dollars) | Three Months Ended  \nJune 30, 2024 | Six Months Ended  \nJune 30, 2024  \nSales and other operating revenues | 4,372 |  | 4,372 |   \nNet income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil | 398 |  | 398 |   \n  \n\nThe following table presents unaudited pro forma information for the Corporation as if the merger with Pioneer had occurred at the beginning of January 1, 2023:\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nUnaudited (millions of dollars) | Three Months Ended  \nJune 30, 2024 | Six Months Ended  \nJune 30, 2024  \nSales and other operating revenues | 92,167 |  | 178,557 |   \nNet income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil | 9,265 |  | 18,256 |   \nThe historical financial information was adjusted to give effect to the pro forma events that were directly attributable to the merger and factually supportable. The unaudited pro forma consolidated results are not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations actually would have been had the merger been completed on January 1, 2023. In addition, the unaudited pro forma consolidated results reflect pro forma adjustments primarily related to conforming Pioneer's accounting policies to ExxonMobil, additional depreciation expense related to the fair value adjustment of the acquired property, plant and equipment, our capital structure, Pioneer's transaction-related costs, and applicable income tax impacts of the pro forma adjustments.\n  \n\nOur transaction costs to effect the acquisition were immaterial.\n10\n* * *\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408825000042/xom-20250630.htm#i3fa947d5ca3846dca30fa994179f4ef9_7)\nNote 3. Litigation and Other Contingencies\nLitigation\nA variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, \u201csignificant\u201d includes material matters, as well as other matters, which management believes should be disclosed.\nState and local governments and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States and its territories have filed a number of legal proceedings against several oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting unprecedented legal and equitable relief for various alleged injuries purportedly connected to climate change. These lawsuits assert a variety of novel, untested claims under statutory and common law. Additional such lawsuits may be filed. We believe the legal and factual theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless and represent an inappropriate attempt to use the court system to usurp the proper role of policymakers in addressing the societal challenges of climate change.\nLocal governments in Louisiana have filed unprecedented legal proceedings against a number of oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting compensation for the restoration of coastal marsh erosion in the state. We believe the factual and legal theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless.\nWhile the outcome of any litigation can be unpredictable, we believe the likelihood is remote that the ultimate outcomes of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. We will continue to defend vigorously against these claims.\nOther Contingencies\nThe Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at June 30, 2025, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts.

Under this method, the change in the carrying value of the financial instruments due to foreign exchange fluctuations is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of June 30, 2025, the Corporation has designated $3.5 billion of its Euro-denominated debt and related accrued interest as a net investment hedge of its European business. The net investment hedge is deemed to be perfectly effective.\nThe Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $0.7 billion as of the end of second quarter 2025.\n  \n\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Corporation\u2019s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity, and the complementary nature of its business segments reduce the Corporation\u2019s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line \u201cSales and other operating revenue\" and in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in \u201cCash Flows from Operating Activities\u201d. The Corporation\u2019s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation\u2019s financial position as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, or results of operations for the periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.\nThe Corporation operates a program to hedge certain of its fixed-rate debt instruments against changes in fair value due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. This program utilizes fair value hedge accounting. The derivative (hedging) instruments are fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps, with settlement dates that correspond to the interest payments associated with the fixed-rate debt (hedged item). Changes in the fair values of the hedging instruments are perfectly offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items; the effects of these changes in fair values are recorded in \"Interest expense\" in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This program was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of second quarter 2025. \nCredit risk associated with the Corporation\u2019s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting, and monitoring of derivative activity.\nThe net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, was as follows: \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n(millions) | June 30, 2025 | December 31, 2024  \nCrude oil (barrels) | \u2014 |  | 13 |   \nPetroleum products (barrels) | (26) |  | (32) |   \nNatural gas (MMBTUs) | (647) |  | (675) |   \n|  |   \nRealized and unrealized gains/(losses) on derivative instruments that were recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income are included in the following lines on a before-tax basis:\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n(millions of dollars) | Three Months Ended  \nJune 30, | Six Months Ended  \nJune 30,  \n2025 | 2024 | 2025 | 2024  \nSales and other operating revenue | 515 |  | (103) |  | 534 |  | (895) |   \nCrude oil and product purchases | 4 |  | (5) |  | 6 |  | (2) |   \n|  |  |  |   \nTotal | 519 |  | (108) |  | 540 |  | (897) |   \n15\n* * *\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408825000042/xom-20250630.htm#i3fa947d5ca3846dca30fa994179f4ef9_7)\nNote 8.

Yet that appears to be how Microsoft responded to a shareholder proposal filed by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). (Microsoft\u2019s answer came in the form of an opposition statement to the proposal, which is on file with the author of this op ed.)\nThe proposal sought basic transparency about the company\u2019s European Security Program and its potential implications for political expression. Instead of engaging, Microsoft waved away the concerns, insisting that it \u201cfail[s] to see\u201d how its activities could chill free speech. That answer is not good enough.\nThe shareholder proposal at issue was straightforward. It asked Microsoft to clarify whether its work in Europe\u2014particularly in partnership with governments and nongovernmental organizations\u2014could expose the company to pressures that would compromise viewpoint neutrality. Shareholders should be told what safeguards exist to prevent European-style speech restrictions from influencing how Microsoft\u2019s technology is employed. The proposal did not ask the company to change its business model or stop protecting customers from cyberattacks. It asked for transparency.\nMicrosoft\u2019s opposition statement seemed designed to shut down the conversation rather than open it. The company appeared to assert that defending against cyberattacks is unrelated to free expression, as though the two issues exist in isolation. But investors know that the line between cybersecurity and speech regulation is not always so neat. Authoritarian regimes, and even democratic governments, sometimes justify censorship under the banner of \u201csafety\u201d or \u201csecurity.\u201d That is why shareholders are right to ask how Microsoft ensures that its partnerships in Europe do not bleed into viewpoint discrimination.\nThere are reasons for concern. Independent watchdogs have flagged Microsoft for ideological bias in how it evaluates and manages content. Reports from the 1792 Exchange (here and here) and Alliance Defending Freedom\u2019s Viewpoint Diversity Score project (here) point to a pattern of one-sided decision-making that tends to disfavor conservative or dissenting perspectives. Then there are the House Judiciary Committee subpoenas from earlier this year related to apparent corporate involvement, including Microsoft, in censorship of U.S. citizens at the behest of foreign governments. None of this proves that \n* * *\nthe company\u2019s European programs are censorious. But it does demonstrate a track record that justifies scrutiny.\nEqually troubling is Microsoft\u2019s lack of engagement with NCPPR, the shareholder proponent of the proposal. While SEC rules contemplate corporate engagement with proposal proponents, and Microsoft\u2019s own public disclosures tout its commitment to engaging with shareholders, Microsoft never engaged NCPPR on this matter beyond sending its opposition statement. (Elsewhere, Microsoft states: \u201cEffective corporate governance includes regular, constructive conversations with our shareholders to proactively seek shareholder insights and to answer shareholder inquiries.\u201d) If Microsoft is confident its programs pose no risk to free expression, why not walk NCPPR through its reasoning? Why not demonstrate safeguards? Silence only invites suspicion.\nThen there is Microsoft\u2019s reliance on the Global Network Initiative (GNI) as a proxy for accountability. In its opposition statement, the company pointed to its founding membership in GNI as evidence that it takes free expression seriously. Yet shareholders are entitled to ask whether GNI oversight is sufficient. Where are the conservative voices in that process? Does the initiative provide real ideological diversity, or does it reinforce the same perspectives shareholders are already concerned about? All these concerns could ultimately be unfounded, but by not engaging NCPPR directly Microsoft just fosters suspicion.\nTo be clear, no one is disputing the importance of cybersecurity. Protecting citizens and institutions from digital threats is a vital service. Nor is anyone claiming to have definitive proof that Microsoft\u2019s European Security Program will inevitably be repurposed to include censorship. NCPPR would welcome evidence that these fears are unfounded. But the absence of such evidence\u2014combined with the company\u2019s seemingly dismissive response only underscores the need for greater transparency. For example, the proposal specifically references two concerning organizations that tout their commitment to combatting \u201conline hate speech\u201d and \u201charmful content\u201d directly identified by Microsoft as participating in the program, but Microsoft either ignores the substance of those concerns or ignores the named entity entirely.\nShareholders are not asking for micromanagement of Microsoft\u2019s operations. They are asking for accountability on a matter that goes directly to reputational and financial risk. If Microsoft were found to be complicit in ideologically driven censorship abroad, the fallout could significantly damage shareholder value. As NCPPR notes in its proposal, Facebook lost roughly $134 billion in market value in connection with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Transparency is the best protection against that outcome.\nMicrosoft\u2019s leadership had an opportunity to reassure investors by addressing the proposal seriously. Instead, it chose to minimize the issue and rely on vague appeals to trust. That \n* * *\nmay be expedient in the short term, but it is shortsighted in the long run. A company of Microsoft\u2019s size and influence cannot afford to appear indifferent to legitimate shareholder concerns about free expression.\nThe path forward is simple: engage with critics, demonstrate safeguards, and commit to viewpoint neutrality in all partnerships. If Microsoft is as confident as it claims, it should have nothing to hide. Until it does so, shareholders are right to keep asking hard questions.\n`II.`**The Global Network Initiative: A Quiet Risk for Free Expression?**\nHow companies may be complicit in censoring legitimate speech through their GNI Membership\n(Internal links available at https://dustindevito.substack.com/p/the-global-network-initiative-a-quiet\nMany companies have leaned on their association with the Global Network Initiative (GNI) to reassure stakeholders that their products aren\u2019t being used to censor legitimate speech. On its face, that sounds comforting. After all, who could object to an organization that claims to be a \u201cmultistakeholder collaboration to protect freedom of expression and privacy in tech\u201d?\nBut scratch beneath the surface, and a more complicated picture emerges.\n**The Precedent: GARM**\nThis isn\u2019t the first time major corporations have used industry groups as cover. Many companies that claim to champion free speech were previously members of the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM). This \u201cresponsible media\u201d group which was publicly aiming to counteract \u201charmful content\u201d was privately working to censoring mainstream perspectives online.\nGARM\u2019s brand safety framework demonetized or suppressed content it deemed to:\n`\u00b7`Spread \u201chate speech\u201d or \u201cmisinformation\u201d \n`\u00b7`Discuss \u201cdebated social issues in a negative or partisan context\u201d \n`\u00b7`\u201cVilif[y]\u201d individuals based on sexual orientation or gender identity \nIn practice, that meant legitimate speech from mainstream voices, including The Federalist, The Daily Wire, and The New York Post, was flagged and suppressed. GARM members were, at minimum, complicit in this censorship.\n**Enter: The Global Network Initiative (GNI)**\nAlthough the GNI\u2019s framework differs from GARM\u2019s, the outcome is not necessarily distinct. The GNI is governed by its Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy, which, \n* * *\naccording to its website, \u201cprovide high-level guidance to the tech industry on how to respect, protect, and advance users\u2019 rights\u201d when governments impose demands or restrictions.\nThese principles are \u201cbased on internationally recognized laws and standards for human rights\u201d, including:\n`\u00b7`The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) \n`\u00b7`The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) \n`\u00b7`The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) \nThe application of GNI\u2019s principles is further informed by:\n`\u00b7`The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles) \n`\u00b7`The Protect, Respect, and Remedy Framework \n`\u00b7`OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises \nOn the surface, these documents contain boilerplate human-rights language no one opposes. However, hidden in some of these documents is a catch.\n**The \u201cOther Status\u201d Clause**\nDocuments like the ICCPR and ICESCR prohibit discrimination on grounds such as race, sex, religion, but also \u201cother status.\u201d This vague phrase has, in recent years, been interpreted to include gender identity.\nIn practice, this means speech challenging gender ideology could be construed as discriminatory under GNI\u2019s guiding framework. And if GNI members, like Google or Microsoft, are bound to these interpretations, they may end up censoring lawful, legitimate viewpoints simply because they cut against prevailing progressive norms.\nIt is also worth noting that GNI\u2019s internal Code of Conduct explicitly recognizes gender identity as a protected category.\n**Case Study 19: LGBT Apps in Asia**\nIn case anyone thinks this is hyperbolic, GNI\u2019s own materials illustrate this risk. In its 2018/2019 report, The GNI Principles at Work, GNI highlighted real-world case studies on freedom of expression and privacy challenges in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector, showing how governments and companies interact in ways that affect human rights online. This report uses real-world examples, including censorship requests, surveillance demands, and content removals, to illustrate the application of the Global Network Initiative Principles.\n* * *\nCase Study 19 provides a great example of how GNI Principles could influence the decisions of major tech companies. This case involves governments in Asia requesting the removal of 65 LGBT-related applications, including dating services and community platforms, from app stores. According to the company that received the government request for takedown, it came with a threat of police action and blocking the company from operating in the country.\nTo avoid this scenario, the company applied a step-by-step review for each app:\n`1.`Has this app violated any developer content policies or terms of use? \n`2.`Has the content from this app directly violated any local laws, including obscenity laws? \n`3.`If there are any identified issues, can they be corrected by the app developer? \n`4.`What impact would the removal of the app have on human rights? \nIn short, some apps were removed for violating company policies or obscenity laws, but many remained since the company \u201cidentified freedom of expression and association as key issues at stake\u201d.\nGNI frames this case study as a vindication of its Principles and a victory for the LGBT community. While the case study does not explicitly state it, the takedown request contravened international law and the GNI Principles by discriminating against individuals based on their \u201cgender identity\u201d - an area safeguarded under the ICCPR\u2019s and the ICESCR\u2019s \u201cother status\u201d provision.\nThis framing is revealing: GNI recognizes \u201cgender identity\u201d as a real ontological category, the acknowledgement and protection of which is essential to the advancement of human rights. Therefore, when a government restricts transgender content, according to the GNI Principles, this would be discriminatory. Pre-emptively labeling content that challenges the concept of gender identity as discriminatory and in violation of international law contributes to a climate where those who do not believe in modern gender ideology are unable or unwilling to respectfully voice dissent for fear of online, legal, or physical consequences.\n**Following the Money**\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that the GNI has received funding from George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation and is currently supported by the Ford Foundation, two organizations well known for advancing progressive political causes.\nThis doesn\u2019t automatically discredit the GNI. But it does raise questions about ideological leanings and whether its guidance to members reflects a genuinely neutral defense of expression or the advancement of a particular worldview.\n* * *\n**A Solid Yellow Flag**\nHere\u2019s the concern: as long as the GNI\u2019s framework is grounded in human rights treaties that include the elastic phrase \u201cother status,\u201d there is no guarantee that its members won\u2019t use or be complicit in their services censoring legitimate speech.\nThe risks of using GNI\u2019s framework are not as obvious as the risks of using GARM\u2019s were (for those who read its Brand Safety Framework anyway). But risks are there all the same. So when companies raise their GNI membership as a defense from concerns over censorship, stakeholders should not back off from pressing for clarity.\nMembership in the Global Network Initiative should not reassure us that companies are not censoring speech, but it also should not make us panic. For now, it should raise a solid yellow flag.\nTHE FOREGOING INFORMATION MAY BE DISSEMINATED TO SHAREHOLDERS VIA TELEPHONE, U.S. MAIL, E-MAIL, CERTAIN WEBSITES AND CERTAIN SOCIAL MEDIA VENUES, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS INVESTMENT ADVICE OR AS A SOLICITATION OF AUTHORITY TO VOTE YOUR PROXY. \nTHE COST OF DISSEMINATING THE FOREGOING INFORMATION TO SHAREHOLDERS IS BEING BORNE ENTIRELY BY THE FILERS. \nTHE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN HAS BEEN PREPARED FROM SOURCES BELIEVED RELIABLE BUT IS NOT GUARANTEED BY US AS TO ITS TIMELINESS OR ACCURACY, AND IS NOT A COMPLETE SUMMARY OR STATEMENT OF ALL AVAILABLE DATA.

On July 1, 2025, 59 Microsoft shareholders, collectively representing more than $80 million in MSFT shares, filed a shareholder proposal calling on Microsoft to publish a report assessing the effectiveness of its Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) processes. It requests that Microsoft evaluate whether its AI and cloud technologies are being misused by customers, such as military entities, to commit human rights abuses or violations of international hu-manitarian law. WHY? On September 25, 2025, The Guardian reported that Microsoft had restricted Israeli military use of certain technol-ogies after journalistic investigations revealed they had been employed in mass surveillance of Palestinians. This followed an earlier Company review, which purportedly found its Azure and AI technologies had not been used in ways that breached Microsoft's terms of service or AI Code of Conduct. The decision to act only after persistent media reporting and employee and public outcry illustrates that Microsoft's HRDD processes did not identify or address significant human rights risks, revealing gaps in oversight and review. This isn't an isolated case. There is a pattern of allegations about Microsoft's complicity in human rights violations in China, Saudi Arabia, and the USA. This suggests systemic issues with Microsoft's HRDD practices.In 2023, Foley Hoag conducted a Human Rights Impact Assessment which recommended that Microsoft assess its military contracts. There has been no public confirmation that Microsoft has done this. These gaps in oversight and review of its due diligence processes pose material risks for investors:? Financial Risk: Potential loss of revenue or increased cost of capital, potential portfolio impacts for investors due to S&P 500 weighting.? Legal and Regulatory Risk: Potential financial liability for the Company under EU laws; potential criminal liability for the Company and its executives for complicity in human rights violations.? Operational Risk: Controversy impacts key talent recruitment and retention; distracts senior management from core business.? Reputational Risks: Microsoft named by UN Special Rapporteur as profiting from, and therefore complicit in, war crimes and genocide in Gaza. Risk of eroding public and customer trust. CONCLUSIONMicrosoft acknowledges that client category and geographic location impact likelihood of product misuse and hu-man rights impacts. Yet it has not demonstrably, consistently translated this awareness into systematic, heightened HRDD. A stream of accusations and the Company's recent decision to cancel one of its contracts with the Israeli military strongly suggest that Microsoft's current, largely reactive measures to allegations of human rights abuses by customers are inadequate. Without a comprehensive, systematic approach to due diligence, shareholders remain exposed to significant material, financial, legal & regulatory, operational, and reputational risks. Supporting the 2025 shareholder resolution is therefore prudent.\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-001.jpg)\nRisky Business: Microsoft has a due diligence problem.

The proposal calls on Microsoft to publish a report assessing the effectiveness of its human rights due diligence (HRDD) processes. It requests that Microsoft evaluate whether its AI and cloud technologies are being misused by customers, such as military entities, to commit human rights abuses or violations of international humanitarian law. This briefing outlines the various allegations which raise questions about the Company's HRDD practices and the adequacy of existing external reviews, and demonstrates why supporting the resolution is necessary to protect shareholder value. KEY ISSUES ? Microsoft recognizes that certain products, customers, and jurisdictions carry elevated risk, but journalistic investigations suggest ineffective HRDD.? 2023 Human Rights Impact Assessment recommended that Microsoft assess its military contracts. No public confirmation that this has been done.? A pattern of allegations about complicity in human rights violations in Israel, China, Saudi Arabia, and the USA. This suggests systemic issues with Microsoft's HRDD practices.? Microsoft's investigations are reactive, narrow, and non-transparent. ? Its recent decision to block Israeli surveillance use confirms the inadequacy of existing processes.MATERIAL RISKS FOR MICROSOFT AND SHAREHOLDERS? Financial Risk: Potential loss of revenue or increased cost of capital, potential portfolio impacts for investors due to S&P 500 weighting.? Legal and Regulatory Risk: Potential financial liability for the Company under EU laws; potential criminal liability for the Company and its executives for complicity in human rights violations.? Operational Risk: Controversy impacts key talent recruitment and retention; distracts senior management from core business.? Reputational Risks: Microsoft named by UN Special Rapporteur as profiting from, and therefore complicit in, war crimes and genocide in Gaza.2 Risk of eroding public and customer trust.On September 25, 2025, The Guardian reported that Microsoft had restricted Israeli military use of certain technol-ogies after journalistic investigations revealed they had been employed in mass surveillance of Palestinians.1 This followed an earlier Company review, which found that its Azure and AI technologies had not been used in ways that breached Microsoft's terms of service or AI Code of Conduct. The decision to act only after persistent media report-ing and employee and public outcry illustrates that Microsoft's HRDD processes did not identify or address signifi-cant human rights risks, revealing gaps in oversight and review. This poses material risks for investors.2\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-003.jpg)\n3MICROSOFT'S HRDD IS INADEQUATEThe UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (\"UNGPs\")3 constitute the global authoritative framework outlining human rights responsibilities of states and businesses, and expectations are heightened for companies with business activities in conflict-affected and high- risk areas. Companies are expected to take all reasonable steps to ensure their products and services - including the deployment of such technologies by customers - are not used to violate human rights. To meet these obligations, companies should conduct HRDD to identify, prevent, miti-gate, and account for adverse human rights impacts, and to transparently report on the effectiveness of such HRDD. Microsoft states it conducts ongoing HRDD across its value chain, in line with its obligations under the UNGPs,4 but it provides insufficient information about the effectiveness of its HRDD processes related to customer end use.5Despite Microsoft's policies suggesting that the Company undertakes proactive and ongoing due diligence, potential misuse of its products has been uncovered not by internal HRDD but by investigative journalism. Foley Hoag's human rights impact assessment (\"HRIA\") highlighted that \"Microsoft describes its human rights management as \"hub-and-spoke,\" intended to empower and support front line personnel to identify and address legal and policy issues, including human rights issues. To that end, Microsoft's teams do not typically follow a formal set of processes and protocols to identify and assess potential human rights risks.\"6 Foley Hoag noted that \"[c]onsequently, Microsoft has few internal policies and procedures that could be used by personnel as guidance to establish a standardized process for the identification, assessment, and elevation of human rights risks.\"7Beyond failures of human rights due diligence, Microsoft's conduct also raises questions about compliance with its primary Codes of Conduct in the Microsoft Services Agreement. These codes prohibit illegal activity and any behavior that harms or threatens to harm others, particularly children. Continued contracts with state and non-state actors implicated in systematic human rights abuses and violations, including those contravening international humanitarian law, represent not only process failures in HRDD but also negligence in enforcing the company's basic user policies and standards.Further, the Company's actions may constitute Business and Human Rights standards norms breaches. Recently issued guidance by the Church of England and a consortium of institutional investors and human rights experts categorizes cases of \"Company Breaches of Norms\" as substantive failures involving direct or enabling complicity in human rights violations.8 According to their guidance, if Microsoft conducts ongoing business operations with nation states involved in numerous and continual human rights violations, this could constitute being categorized as a \"Norms Breach Company\", designated at the highest level of harm in terms of severity and irreversibility, exposing the Company to heightened shareholder scrutiny and potential exclusion from investment portfolios.The cumulative effect, despite the Company's claims to the contrary, is a risk management approach that is reac-tive and that does not assure investors or the public that high-risk client relationships are adequately assessed and monitored. This approach increases reputational, regulatory, and operational risks.\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-004.jpg)\n4HIGH-RISK CLIENTS AND JURISDICTIONS Microsoft recognizes that the nature and specific location of a customer can amplify risks, independently of the product offered requiring elevated scrutiny. Its Responsible AI Framework, for example, imposes limited access restrictions on certain products such as facial recognition tools when sold to government agencies.9 The Company's Global Human Rights Statement reaffirms its commitment to the UNGPs and emphasizes heightened due diligence for certain countries and HRIAs at both a product and corporate level.10 However, given repeated allegations of human rights issues, implementation appears to be uneven, particularly with respect to products such as Azure cloud storage, whose potential of being deployed in a manner harmful to people is less obvious than that of other AI tools, such as facial recognition. 2023 HRIA RECOMMENDED AN ASSESSMENT OF MICROSOFT'S MILITARY CONTRACTSFoley Hoag was commissioned by Microsoft (in response to a shareholder resolution) to conduct an independent HRIA, focused on Microsoft's licensing of cloud services (including those incorporating AI) to U.S. law enforcement (including agencies involved in policing and prisons) and immigration enforcement agencies.11 While the 2023 HRIA found no direct evidence that Microsoft's products and services caused or contributed to human rights harms, Foley Hoag made 23 recommendations. They included that the Company should \"consider conducting theme-specific due diligence exercises or additional HRIAs focused on: [...]assessing the company's commercial relationships with military agencies and their impacts on BIPOC and other vulnerable communities...\"12There is no public disclosure confirming that an HRIA has been done for military clients. These gaps underscore that HRDD practices (especially for high-risk client categories such as military agencies) are not sufficiently visible to investors or stakeholders.\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-005.jpg)\n5A PATTERN OF CONTROVERSY AND QUESTIONS ABOUT DUE DILIGENCEDespite the Company's claims that it carries out ongoing and proactive due diligence, there is a pattern of allega-tions over many years of involvement in facilitating civil and human rights abuses and human rights violations. This raises significant concerns for investors about the Company's oversight and HRDD processes.5CHINA: ENABLING MASS SURVEILLANCE IN XINJIANGIn September 2025 Associated Press13 reported that Microsoft provided cloud services to Landasoft, a Chinese surveillance company implicated in the repression of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. According to the report, Landasoft registered accounts on Microsoft Azure in 2018 seeking to expand cloud offerings to police clients. Microsoft con-firmed that Landasoft accessed Azure through a self-service portal, which was retired in 2021, and stated that any data related to Landasoft was deleted. While factually accurate, the self-service framing does not remove Microsoft's responsibility under its own human rights policies: China represents a high-risk environment where, according to Microsoft's own policies, \"heightened due diligence\" should be carried out. Allowing a company with ties to repressive policing to access cloud services without proactive assessment raises questions about Microsoft's HRDD.In another example, Microsoft provided AI and cloud computing services and mentorship to Chinese startups, through its incubator program.14 After graduating the program, some companies have subsequently partnered with the Xinjiang police where their surveillance tools and support have reportedly been used by the Chinese government in its brutal oppression of the Uyghur population.15SAUDI ARABIA: CONCERNS OVER FACILITATING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSAssessments from Freedom House and the U.S. State Department show that Saudi Arabia is a high-risk human rights environment.16 In 2023, Human Rights Watch called on Microsoft to suspend its investment in a new cloud data center region in Saudi Arabia until it can clearly demonstrate how it will mitigate the risk of facilitating serious human rights violations.17 The concern arises from the potential for Saudi authorities to obtain access to data stored in Microsoft's cloud data center, posing threats to human rights and privacy. In 2024 a shareholder resolution calling for a HRIA about the data center in Saudi Arabia and other countries with human rights concerns was filed by Ek? and received a third of the shareholder vote.18ISRAEL: FACILITATING MASS SURVEILLANCE OF CIVILIANS In 2019, Microsoft invested in AnyVision which faced scrutiny following media reports that its technology was used to surveil Palestinians who lived in the occupied West Bank.19 Microsoft hired a team from Covington & Burling and former US AG Eric Holder to investigate the claims.5\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-006.jpg)\n6Microsoft decided to divest from AnyVision despite investigation finding that the AnyVision technology was not used in mass surveillance.In 2025 Microsoft faced allegations that its Azure cloud and AI tools were used by the Israeli Military to carry out mass surveillance and cause civilian harm - see below for further details. UNITED STATES: HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRACTSIn response to shareholder concerns, Microsoft commissioned a HRIA conducted by the law firm Foley Hoag LLP. The assessment, published in June 2023, examined the impact of Microsoft's cloud and artificial intelligence technologies licensed to U.S. federal and state law enforcement and immigration enforcement agencies. The HRIA found that while Microsoft has robust human rights policies, there are areas where the company can improve, particularly regarding its consulting services provided to law enforcement agencies, and offered recommendations on improving HRDD. MASS SURVEILLANCE OF CIVILIANS BY ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE AGENCYMicrosoft's recent announcement that it found \"evidence that supports\" Israel's Unit 8200 used its technologies in violation of the terms of service highlight weaknesses in the Company's HRDD and internal and external reviews.In early 2025, The Guardian20 and the Associated Press21 reported that Israel's military relied on Microsoft technology during its Gaza offensive, raising concerns that Azure cloud and AI tools could have been used in operations potentially posing risks to civilians. In response, Microsoft commissioned an internal review and engaged an external firm to undertake additional fact-finding. In May 2025, Microsoft announced that the review concluded there was \"no evidence that Microsoft's Azure and AI technologies, or any of our other software, have been used to harm people or that IMOD has failed to comply with our terms of service or our AI Code of Conduct.\"22 However, the review's method-ology, scope, full final report, or even the name of the external law firm were not disclosed. The absence of key information including which staff were consulted and how much reliance was placed on staff assurances, what data was examined, and how civilian harm was defined and assessed, makes it difficult to evaluate the adequacy of the review. Further reporting from the Guardian and others also raises questions about the robustness of that review. In August 2025, a joint investigation by The Guardian,23 +972 Magazine,24 and Local Call25 alleged that Unit 8200, an Israeli military intelligence unit, had used Microsoft's Azure cloud to store roughly 200 million hours of Palestinian phone call recordings from Gaza and the West Bank. The data, described as stored in \"a customized and segregated area within Azure,\" including data centers in the Netherlands and Ireland,26 was reportedly used to inform military targeting decisions, including operations that posed risks to civilians. \n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-007.jpg)\n7The investigation, based on internal Microsoft documents and interviews with 11 sources from the Company and Israeli military intelligence, alleged that some Microsoft engineers were aware the data included raw intelligence, while Israel-based staff, including Unit 8200 alumni, appeared to understand the military objectives. The fact that evidence existed internally but was unavailable to the first review casts serious doubt on the adequacy of that assessment.Following this reporting, Microsoft commissioned a second external review, to be led by Covington & Burling LLP with independent consultancy assistance, to examine allegations of mass surveillance that could constitute a breach of its Terms of Service.27 Microsoft has not confirmed to date whether Covington & Burling was also the external firm involved in the first review. Microsoft has a long-standing commercial relationship with Covington & Burling LLP, and Microsoft's Vice Chair and President, Brad Smith, who oversees Microsoft's implementation of its human rights commitments,28 was once a partner at the law firm29 creating at least perception of a conflict of interest.Microsoft subsequently announced on September 25, 2025, that it would cancel the specific contract with the Israeli military while continuing to work with them as a client. While this demonstrates that credible risks of real-world harm existed and required Microsoft to take corrective action, it also confirms that the first review failed to identify them. After the cancellation, Brad Smith sent a note to staff emphasizing that the second review \"...had not accessed any customer data but its findings were based on a review of internal Microsoft documents, emails and messages between staff\"30 and credited the Guardian reporting for bringing to light \"information we could not access in light of our customer privacy commitments.\"31 However, the Guardian's reporting relied in part on internal Microsoft documents indicating that information needed to assess risk was available internally during the first review but was not examined. The second review appeared to focus narrowly on whether cloud storage was used for mass surveillance, and seems not to explicitly address allegations that the stored data was used in military operations potentially harmful to civilians.32 The August 2025 reporting by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call highlighted these risks and prompted the second review, yet Microsoft treats these allegations as distinct from those addressed by the first re-view. In reality, they are the same category of risks, demonstrating that the first review did not, at minimum, examine the internal documents later cited by the investigative reporting. Given that Microsoft has revised its assessment of violation of its terms of service, it is unclear why the allegations of civilian-harm are not also being revisited.The sequence of events highlights weaknesses in and unresolved questions about Microsoft's HRDD, oversight, review processes, and transparency when it comes to high-risk client relationships. The prudent course of action at this time is to formally assess the effectiveness of Microsoft's HRDD practices in preventing, identifying, and addressing customer misuse of Microsoft AI and cloud products or services that violate human rights or international humanitarian law.The Guardian, August 6, 2025+972 Magazine, August 6, 2025\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-008.jpg)\n8ADEQUACY OF EXISTING EXTERNAL INVESTIGATIONSMicrosoft's response to these allegations has followed a familiar pattern: commissioning external reviews that conclude with \"no evidence\" of misuse, but new allegations continue to arise. In 2020, Covington & Burling LLP found no breach in relation to Microsoft's investment in the Israeli surveillance firm AnyVision although the Company subsequently divested. In 2023, the Foley Hoag HRIA reached similar no evidence of harm findings regarding Microsoft's services and products by US law enforcement agencies. The first review into Israeli military contracts in early 2025 repeated this formula, concluding that Azure and AI technologies had not been used to harm civilians or violate Microsoft's terms of services. This pattern suggests structural deficiencies in Microsoft's HRDD including insufficient mechanisms to assess real-world impacts of high-risk clients, and raise questions about the scope and adequacy of external reviews. They are typically narrow in scope, and sometimes constrained by client agreements or Terms of Service that can limit disclosure, as seen in the Foley Hoag HRIA. Their opacity is heightened when methodologies, terms of reference, or full reports are withheld, making it impossible to assess rigor or scope, or where their conclusions amount to mere blanket statements (e.g., \"found no evidence\"), which provide little basis for stakeholders or investors to evaluate whether underlying risks have been materially reduced.Microsoft's deference to Terms of Service and customer privacy commitments to define what can be investigated reflects a choice that limits its own ability to assess potential human rights abuses using their products by high-risk clients.33 Even when investigative reporting identifies potential misuse, internal reviews may be constrained from fully examining the facts, creating structural gaps in HRDD.Investors should support an independent review of Microsoft's HRDD to ensure high-risk client use is properly assessed and potential human rights risks are effectively mitigated.\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-009.jpg)\n9MATERIAL RISKS FOR INVESTORSThe recurring nature of these allegations suggests systemic issues with Microsoft's HRDD practices especially when it comes to high-risk clients such as military agencies. Inadequate HRDD exposes Microsoft to material, legal, operational, and reputational risks.Microsoft's potential complicity in international crimes in Gaza has resulted in outspoken opposition from its own employees,34 a boycott and divestment campaign against the Company,35 severe reputational damage that may harm long-term shareholder value, and risks exposing the company to legal and regulatory penalties.? FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RISK: ? Enterprises, governments, and other large customers may avoid association with companies under hu-man-rights or surveillance controversy. Loss of business, or demands for contract renegotiation and higher indemnification, can directly reduce revenue and margins. The UN Human Rights Council has highlighted the business risks of corporate complicity in conflict-affected areas.36? Meeting the criteria of a \"Norms Breach Company\" of international human rights standards, can expose the Company to shareholder action, engagement escalation, or exclusion from investment portfolios, which in turn can increase the Company's cost of capital.37? LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK: If voice recordings obtained through mass surveillance of civilians are stored in any Microsoft Data Centers located in Ireland or the Netherlands, this will likely breach the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. If any of this data involves calls between people in the EU and in the West Bank or Gaza, this is likely an additional breach of the rights of EU citizens. The collection of this data does not appear to fall within any of the six legal grounds that allow for collection defined under the regulation. It is likely that com-plaints will be lodged with the EU lead's data protection authority - Ireland's Data Protection Commission - calling on the agency to investigate.The Dutch government announced they would \"request further investigation\", and if there are serious indica-tions of criminal offences, then the public prosecutor's office could decide to initiate legal proceedings.38It is also possible that efforts will be made to hold the company and/or its executives responsible in the courts if there is evidence of complicity in human rights violations. Universal jurisdiction, the principle that certain grave crimes (e.g., genocide, crimes against humanity) can be prosecuted irrespective of where they were committed or the nationality of perpetrators or victims, is increasingly being tested in the context of corporate complicity in human rights violations. This presents heightened legal and reputational risk for companies and their investors. Substantiated allegations such as misuse of cloud services, GDPR violations, or human rights harms could also increase perceived risk, raising equity risk premiums and pushing up the cost of debt as lenders incorporate litigation and regulatory exposure into credit spreads.399\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-010.jpg)\n10? OPERATIONAL RISK: Involvement in controversial partnerships that attract the attention of the media, civil society, and regulators can distract senior management from Microsoft's core business objectives. Employee protests and activism over controversial contracts can depress morale, erode trust in management, increase quits, and slow delivery in mission-critical teams.42 At a time when tech companies are competing intensely for key employees to win the competitive race on AI, Microsoft can ill afford to undermine its ability to acquire and retain top talent. ? REPUTATIONAL RISK: In June 2025, United Nations Special Rapporteur, Francesca Albanese, presented a new report - \"From economy of occupation to economy of genocide\"- to the United Nations' Human Rights Coun-cil, which names companies she says are profiting from, and therefore complicit in, war crimes and genocide in Gaza.43 She includes Microsoft, noting its decades-long involvement in Israel and the extensive access Micro-soft grants the Israeli government to its AI technologies, data analytics, and surveillance.44 Microsoft is facing repeated allegations of its products being used to facilitate human rights violations, which is drawing internal45 and external criticism46 which is itself continuously generating headlines which damage the company's brand and can erode public and customer trust. ? SYSTEMIC RISK: Microsoft is the second largest stock weights in the S&P 500, at ~6.4%,47 with a market capital-ization of roughly USD 3.8 trillion.48 When a company of this size suffers a reputational or legal shock, the effects ripple through index-tracking portfolios and pension funds. Exposure to Microsoft is often unavoidable for in-vestors. For diversified investors and \"universal owners,\" these portfolio-level impacts of the Company's actions make it essential to monitor potential risks associated with Microsoft's operations and public perception. Addressing the costs of human rights violations may help protect shareholders from economy-wide risks, including those resulting from human rights abuses potentially associated with Microsoft's products. Market performance, and, accordingly, the long-term performance of diversified portfolios, depends on the health of the economy, which can be undermined when companies' activities create social and environmental costs that drag on GDP.49 Conflict and human rights violations can generate spillover effects that disrupt trade, investment, and financial markets beyond local economies.50 Reports indicate that Microsoft's technologies have been linked to LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALLEGED COMPLICITY IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMESLundin Case (Sweden)On 11 November 2021, the Swedish public prosecutor formally charged the chief executive of Lundin Energy (formerly Lundin Petroleum) and the chairman of the Board for aiding and abetting war crimes that occurred between 1999 and 2003 in Sudan, now South Sudan. Both deny the allegations. The trial started on 5 September 2023 and the concluding pleas will be delivered in February and March 2026.40Lafarge Case (France)French cement company Lafarge is facing charges of complicity in crimes against humanity, and financing terrorism and violating an embargo.41 Between 2013 and 2014, Lafarge allegedly made payments to terrorist groups, including ISIS, to continue operations at its Syrian cement plant amidst the civil war.10\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-011.jpg)\n11military targeting and surveillance activities in Gaza, contributing to the destruction of infrastructure, the displacement of communities, and loss of life, factors that depress economic productivity and slow recovery. These dynamics not only weaken local economies but can ripple globally, heightening legal, reputational, and systemic risks, and threatening the long-term returns of diversified investors.51Shareholders need to be assured that the Company's strategy is not mispricing and undervaluing the risks associat-ed with continuing business with customers in violation of the Company's standards and policies. Continuing contracts that bear numerous and compounding material risks and costs to the Company should be weighed against the revenue gained by such contracts and the costs of adequate and efficient due diligence. Negligence to address these due diligence failures raises numerous issues related to the Company's Duty of Care to shareholders. Robust due diligence practices are essential to mitigate these risks. Given repeated allegations, an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's HRDD processes and practices is needed. By taking proactive steps, Microsoft can safeguard its reputation, ensure compliance with international standards, and maintain investor confidence.CONCLUSIONMicrosoft acknowledges that client category and geographic location impact likelihood of product misuse and human rights impacts. Yet it has not demonstrably consistently translated this awareness into systematic, heightened HRDD. External assessments, such as the Foley Hoag HRIA, have explicitly recommended assessing the company's relationship with military agencies and working with stakeholders to discuss priorities for future HRDD but the company has not publicly committed to fully implementing these recommendations. A stream of accusa-tions and the Company's recent decision to cancel one of its contracts with the Israeli military strongly suggest that Microsoft's current, largely reactive measures to allegations of human rights abuses by customers are inadequate. Without a comprehensive, systematic approach to due diligence, shareholders remain exposed to significant material, financial, legal & regulatory, and reputational risks. Supporting the 2025 shareholder resolution is therefore prudent.\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-012.jpg)\n12DISCLAIMERNone of Ek?, Investor Advocates for Social Justice (IASJ), Center for Middle East Investment (CMEI), nor Racial Justice Investing (RJI) are investment or financial advisors, and do not make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in any particular company or investment fund or vehicle.

My name is Aaron Acosta, and on behalf of lead proponents Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary Charitable Trust and the Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary and **57 additional co-filers** , we respectfully request your support for our shareholder proposal at Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), which can be found here. We would welcome the opportunity to meet to discuss the proposal in greater detail. \nThe proposal asks Microsoft to publish a report, assessing the effectiveness of its human rights due diligence (\u201cHRDD\u201d) processes in preventing, identifying, and addressing customer misuse of Microsoft artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) and cloud products or services that violates human rights or international humanitarian law. You can find our exempt solicitation, which explains the material risks, here.\nWe believe support for this shareholder resolution is warranted because Microsoft\u2019s current HRDD appears insufficient in preventing, identifying, and addressing customer misuse of its technologies and services. This was highlighted most recently by the Company\u2019s decision to terminate one of its contracts with the Israeli military, following a journalistic investigation that revealed its technologies had been employed in mass surveillance of Palestinians. Notably, it was the journalistic investigation, not Microsoft\u2019s HRDD, that brought to light the customer misuse. Our exempt solicitation shows that this example of ineffective HRDD is just one of many cases in which the Company\u2019s technologies and services have been used to violate human rights and international humanitarian law, underscoring the importance of the requested report on the effectiveness of Microsoft\u2019s HRDD.\nIneffective HRDD exposes investors to material risks, including:\n| \u25cf |  **Financial Risk** : potential loss of revenue or increased cost of capital, potential portfolio impacts for investors due to S&P 500 weighting.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf |  **Legal and Regulatory Risk** : potential financial liability for the Company under EU laws; potential criminal liability for the Company and its executives for complicity in human rights violations.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf |  **Operational Risk** : negative impacts on key talent recruitment and retention; distractions of senior management from core business.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf |  **Reputational Risks** : Microsoft named by UN Special Rapporteur as profiting from, and therefore complicit in, war crimes and genocide in Gaza. Risk of eroding public and customer trust.  \n---|---|---  \nWe would welcome the opportunity to discuss the shareholder resolution with you.

This Form 10-Q/A also amends certain other Items in the Original Report, as listed in \"Items Amended in this Form 10-Q/A\" below.\n  \n\nThe Company does not intend to amend any other reports previously filed with the SEC other than the Original Report and the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. Accordingly, investors and other readers should rely only on the financial information and related disclosures regarding the Affected Periods in this Form 10-Q/A, the Form 10-K/A and in any other future filings with the SEC (as applicable) and should not rely on any previously furnished or filed reports, press releases, investor presentations or similar communications relating to the Affected Periods.\n  \n\nRestatement Background\n  \n\nAs described in the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 2, 2025, on June 26, 2025, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, after discussion with management and our independent registered public accounting firm, Crowe LLP, concluded that our audited consolidated financial statements as of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and for each year in the three fiscal year periods ended September 30, 2024 contained in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, and our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the interim periods ended December 31, 2024, 2023, 2022, and 2021, March 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, and September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 contained in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q should no longer be relied upon and should be restated because of errors identified in such financial statements, as described below. \n  \n\nThe errors relate to the Company's accounting and financial reporting of certain third-party lending and servicing relationships within the Consumer Solutions business. Historically, we accounted for all borrower payments and credit enhancement payments under these programs on a single unit or net basis, with all such payments presented as interest income representing our effective yield on the portfolios. We determined that these payments should instead be accounted for on a separate unit of account or gross basis, with loan yields and interest income recorded at the gross borrower loan rate, and credit losses and associated provisions for credit losses recorded on a gross basis over the life of the loans, and with all credit enhancement payments and servicing payments recorded separately in noninterest expense (the \u201cGross Basis Approach\u201d). Additionally, there are tax adjustments that relate to the tax impact of the restatement entries discussed. \n  \n\nThe Affected Periods, as applicable, are presented in this Form 10-Q/A to reflect the Gross Basis Approach as described above. The consolidated financial statements are also updated to reflect adjustments to record previously unadjusted audit differences.\n  \n\nIn addition, our management has concluded that there is a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting relating to the errors described above for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. For a discussion of management\u2019s evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and the material weakness identified, see \u201cItem 4 \u2013 Controls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-Q/A. \n  \n\nItems Amended in this Form 10-Q/A\n  \n\nThis Form 10-Q/A presents the Original Report, amended and restated in its entirety, with modifications as necessary to reflect the aforementioned restatement. The following items have been amended to reflect the restated \n  \n\n* * *\n  \n\namounts, related disclosures and updates to our assessment of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures:\n  \n\n\u2022Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements\n  \n\n\u2022Part I, Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n  \n\n\u2022Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures\n  \n\nAs discussed in the notes to the financial statements in Item 1, the Company restated its financial results for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 to correct errors in the presentation of interest income, the allowance for credit losses, provision for credit losses, and noninterest expense related to loans originated under agreements to originate loans marketed and serviced by third-party partners (\u201cProgram Agreements\u201d). While this change resulted in an increase in reported interest income and earlier recognition of credit losses, over the life of the portfolio the net income profile is expected to be unchanged as the increase in interest income is offset by a corresponding increase in noninterest expense and increase in provision for credit losses for amounts owed to the third-parties under the Program Agreements. Because the restatement does not change the net economics of the Program Agreements, the Company has concluded there is no net impact to Earnings At Risk and has not adjusted the amounts previously disclosed. Based on this, Part I, Item 3. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" has not been amended and restated.\n  \n\nIn addition, in accordance with applicable SEC rules, this Form 10-Q/A includes new certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 from our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer dated as of the filing date of this Form 10-Q/A. In accordance with applicable SEC rules, this Form 10-Q/A also includes an updated signature page.\n  \n\nExcept as described above, this Form 10-Q/A does not amend, update or change any other items or disclosures in the Original Report and does not purport to reflect any information or events subsequent to the filing of the Original Report. As such, this Form 10-Q/A speaks only as of the date the Original Report was filed, and we have not undertaken herein to amend, supplement or update any information contained in the Original Report to give effect to any subsequent events. Among other things, forward-looking statements made in the Original Report have not been revised to reflect events, results or developments that occurred or facts that became known to us after the date of the filing of the Original Report. Accordingly, this Form 10-Q/A should be read in conjunction with our filings made with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Original Report, including any amendments to those filings.\n  \n\nThe restatements are more fully described in Note 17. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\n  \n\n* * *\n  \n\nPATHWARD FINANCIAL, INC.\nFORM 10-Q\n  \n\nTable of Contents\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nDescription | Page  \nPART I -

(\"Pathward Financial\" or the \u201cCompany\u201d) received an expected notice (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the \u201cListing Rule\u201d) as a result of its failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (\u201cForm 10-Q\u201d) for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025, as described more fully in the Company's Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on August 11, 2025 (the \u201cForm 12b-25\u201d). The Listing Rule requires listed companies to timely file all periodic reports with the SEC.\n  \n\nThe Company previously reported that it had received a similar Notice from Nasdaq on May 22, 2025 as a result of its failure to timely file its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2025. In accordance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules, the Company submitted a plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule to Nasdaq, and Nasdaq granted the Company an extension to regain compliance with the Listing Rule until November 13, 2025.\n  \n\nThe Notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company's common stock on Nasdaq. The Company filed its amended Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 on August 29, 2025. As disclosed in the Form 12b-25 and the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed on July 2, 2025, the Company is also in the process of amending its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 to restate certain financial statements contained therein and filing its Form 10-Qs for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025; respectively. The restatements related to the Company\u2019s gross vs. net basis presentation and derivative accounting, and financial reporting, of certain third-party lending and servicing relationships within the Consumer Solutions business, within held-for-investment loan balances.\n  \n\nIn accordance with the Notice, the Company has until September 10, 2025 to submit an update to its plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. Pursuant to the Notice, the Company has until September 10, 2025 to submit an update to its plan to regain compliance, but Nasdaq will not further extend the deadline for compliance. The Company intends to take the necessary steps to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules as soon as practicable and in any event prior to the November 13, 2025 deadline.\n  \n\nItem 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.\n  \n\nOn September 2, 2025, the Company issued a press release disclosing the receipt of the Notice. A copy of the press release is being furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.\n  \n\nThe information furnished in this Item 7.01 and Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed \u201cfiled\u201d for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n* * *\n  \n\nForward-Looking Statements\n  \n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The Stock Fund is accounted for in units of a unitized pool of stock and cash. Phantom Stock Units are estimated based on the number of theoretical units credited to the reporting person. Accounts are payable in cash at the end of the deferral period.  \n2. Closing price of Issuer's common stock on NYSE on the relevant date (price used to value units in the Stock Fund).  \n3.

Monroe St., 14th Floor, Chicago, IL 60661  \n---|---|---  \n**This Notice and the attached written materials are filed pursuant to Rule 14a-6(g)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.**\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n---  \nOctober 15, 2025\nDear fellow Tesla shareholders,\n**We encourage shareholders of Tesla, Inc. (\u201cTesla\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) to _vote for Proposal Eleven_ on the Company\u2019s 2025 Proxy Statement. **This proposal asks the Company to adopt a bylaw amendment requiring shareholder ratification within one year of Tesla\u2019s implementation of a bylaw amendment adopting more restrictive requirements for submitting shareholder proposals, as newly permitted under Texas law (Section 21.373 of the Texas Business Organizations Code).\nTesla\u2019s reincorporation in Texas grants the Company new authority to unilaterally impose the thresholds in Section 21.373 of the Texas Business Organizations Code, requiring shareholders or groups of shareholders to hold 3% of the corporation\u2019s voting shares or voting shares of $1 million in market value to submit 14a-8 shareholder proposals. These thresholds exceed current SEC standards and could limit the voices of retail and institutional investors, undermining the Company\u2019s governance structure.\nThe resolved clause of the proposal states:\n_RESOLVED, pursuant to Article X of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Tesla, Inc., shareholders of Tesla, Inc. (\u201cTesla\u201d) hereby amend the Bylaws to add the following to the end of Article X:_\n_\u201c; and provided further, however, that any amendment of these bylaws by the board of directors to make the \u201caffirmative election\u201d referenced in section 21.373(b) of the TBOC to be governed by section 21.373 of the TBOC shall be invalid if it is not ratified within one year of such amendment by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of outstanding voting securities, voting together as a single class.\u201d_\n**Why This Matters Now**\nTesla is navigating a period of volatility \u2013 from leadership transitions to ambitious technological pivots. In such times, robust shareholder rights are an essential means to take the pulse of investor concerns and priorities. Proposal Eleven ensures that future attempts to restrict shareholder input by amending the Company\u2019s bylaws must be ratified by shareholders themselves.\nThis is a reasonable governance safeguard that would enhance Tesla\u2019s commitment to shareholder engagement and accountability. **A vote for Proposal Eleven is a vote to protect shareholder rights.**\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n---  \n**Responding to the Company\u2019s Opposition**\nIn Tesla\u2019s opposition statement to Proposal Eleven, the Board makes several points that warrant further review. Specifically:\n| **1.** |  **Reconciling the Board\u2019s stated commitment to shareholder feedback with its opposition to Proposal Eleven.** The Board emphasizes its commitment to shareholder engagement, stating that \u201c[t]he Board has consistently demonstrated its commitment to shareholders\u2019 ability to communicate with Tesla or with each other.\u201d The Board further notes that investor feedback has helped inform the Board and contributed to the adoption of governance and disclosure practices. In the Letter to Shareholders at the top of the Proxy Statement, Board Chair Robyn Denholm and Director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson highlight Tesla\u2019s reincorporation in Texas, writing: \u201cWe are in Texas because it provides a more predictable corporate governance framework that allows us to hear from you as the people who know Tesla best \u2013  \n---|---|---  \nIf the Board actively seeks to hear from shareholders, it is difficult to reconcile this stated commitment with its opposition to Proposal Eleven. This proposal simply asks that a supermajority of shareholders be required to ratify the Board\u2019s implementation of a bylaw amendment adopting Texas Business Organizations Code thresholds for shareholder proposals \u2013 thresholds that would directly impact shareholders\u2019 ability to communicate with the Board and Company management. Notably, the Board offers no assurance it will refrain from adopting the more stringent submission thresholds.\n| **2.** |  **Responding to the supermajority argument.** The Board argues that Proposal Eleven could impose a new supermajority voting requirement, which they state could be detrimental to shareholders. This argument fails to appreciate the purpose of the proposal, which is to invalidate a bylaw adopting the more restrictive thresholds for filing shareholder proposals allowed under Texas law if not ratified by a supermajority of shareholders.  \n---|---|---  \nProposal Eleven provides an additional opportunity for shareholders to oppose such an amendment when such significant rights are at issue.\n| 3. |  **Responding to the Board\u2019s flexibility argument.** The Board argues that the presence of multiple shareholder proposals addressing Section 21.373 of the Texas Business Organizations Code underscores the need for Board flexibility. Proposal Eleven does not constrain the Board\u2019s ability to evaluate or consider governance options. The Board retains full discretion to assess and recommend governance decisions. Proposal Eleven does not interfere with that discretion \u2013 it simply ensures that if the Board chooses to restrict shareholders\u2019 ability to submit proposals by amending its bylaws, it must seek shareholder ratification to maintain such a change. Ensuring shareholders have an additional protection in relation to a decision such as this that affects their rights is not only fair, but it would also build trust and confidence among shareholders as well as contribute to the development of a more transparent, responsive governance structure.  \n---|---|---  \n**We encourage our fellow investors to _vote for Proposal Eleven_ as a clear step toward protecting our rights as shareholders and ensuring that the Company acts in alignment with its investors.**\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n---  \n_IMPORTANT NOTICE: The cost of this communication is being borne entirely by the Office of the Illinois State Treasurer.

Most critics are missing the point**\n_Dr. Shane Goodwin is Executive Director of the SMU Corporate Governance Initiative, a collaborative effort between the Cox School of Business and Dedman School of Law at Southern Methodist University._\nFortune\nBy Dr. Shane Goodwin\n14 October 2025\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465925099333/tm252289d35_defa14aimg19.jpg)\n_Dr. Shane Goodwin served as a Governance Advisor to the Tesla Board\u2019s Special Committee on the development of Elon Musk\u2019s incentive compensation proposals. The viewpoints expressed below reflect those of Dr. Goodwin and not necessarily those of the Tesla Board or its Special Committee._\nThere has been no shortage of headlines and _clickbait opinions [fortune.com]_ from so-called \u201cexperts\u201d about Tesla\u2019s proposed compensation package for its once-in-a-generation CEO Elon Musk, yet most of them have thus far missed the point.\nIt\u2019s easy to pass judgment from the metaphorical corporate governance ivory tower, but I was in the room as a governance advisor to the Tesla Board\u2019s Special Committee and have a direct understanding of the thoughtful strategy behind this performance award. This plan was developed through a best-in-class corporate governance process. How do I know that? I have over 30 years of experience in corporate governance, M&A, and board leadership as an advisor, practitioner, educator, and expert witness \u2014 I\u2019ve seen these processes play out countless times and know what effective and thoughtful board oversight looks like. Let me tell you why this is the right plan for Tesla and its shareholders. \nThis plan wouldn\u2019t pay Elon based on promises \u2014 it is 100% contingent on a framework that requires achievement of market capitalization and operational milestones in support of his vision and ties his incentives directly to meeting those milestones. When you consider the details of the plan, it\u2019s clear that creating extraordinary value for shareholders is the absolute priority. \nWhile this compensation plan may be atypical and not what shareholders and governance experts are used to, it is a true corporate governance masterclass by the Tesla Board\u2019s Special Committee. This is a real-world governance approach focused entirely on how to maximize long-term results for shareholders, the owners of Tesla. In an era when executive compensation philosophy is often criticized for rewarding mediocre performance or short-term thinking at the expense of long-term strategy, Tesla\u2019s approach stands out for its rigor and emphasis on accountability. Elon wins ONLY if Tesla shareholders win, and win big. \n**Why now \u2014 retaining a visionary when it matters most**\nAs Tesla\u2019s focus shifts towards AI, robotics and sustainable energy products, the company is at an inflection point. The Board\u2019s view is clear: Elon has a singular vision to lead Tesla forward, and retaining and motivating him is critical for the company\u2019s future success. The Board recognized that standing still amidst Tesla\u2019s evolution would be reckless and thus acted in the company\u2019s best interest by taking swift action to secure Elon\u2019s leadership when it mattered most.\nThe business risk of losing the leader who continues to drive Tesla\u2019s innovation and attract the talent required to stand out in a crowded landscape is clear. The competition for top engineering and AI talent is getting hotter by the minute, and much of Tesla\u2019s appeal as an employer and innovator is directly tied to Elon. The Board\u2019s view is that Elon\u2019s one-of-a-kind leadership is key not only to Tesla\u2019s next phase of growth, but also to securing deep layers of impressive talent that are necessary to accomplish Tesla\u2019s goals. The cost of losing that leadership would be far higher than the cost of a well-structured, performance-only award that is 100% aligned with shareholders.\n**Gold standard special committee process**\nTake it from a professor and former investment banker \u2014 the creation of this plan was not an academic exercise in corporate governance. A disinterested Special Committee conducted a seven-month process, retained its own legal, compensation, valuation, accounting, and governance advisors, negotiated directly with Elon and deliberated extensively among themselves with the full Tesla Board (excluding Elon and Kimbal Musk). The full report has been publicly filed to permit shareholders to scrutinize the process and the conclusions. The Board could not have been more transparent.\n**No results, no reward**\nWhile headlines are focusing on the numbers, this plan focuses on real results for Tesla and its shareholders \u2014 sustained market capitalization milestones, staggering adjusted EBITDA hurdles, real-world product deployment and Elon remaining in a leadership role at the company and developing the next generation of leaders \u2014 for Elon to get paid and receive any additional voting influence over Tesla\u2019s strategic direction. This means his incentives are not just tied to hitting highly ambitious targets, but also to ensuring those results are sustained over the long haul. At the same time, the plan prudently addresses retention of Tesla\u2019s visionary leader through vesting periods of up to 10 years after the grant date. \nVoting power is the primary motivating factor for Elon. He has _spoken publicly [x.com]_ about a desire for greater influence over the direction of Tesla\u2019s AI deployment. This plan provides an opportunity for enhanced ownership, but not so much that Elon can\u2019t still be overturned by his fellow shareholders. \nThe operational and financial milestones create clear alignment between shareholder value creation and Elon\u2019s compensation. If Elon doesn\u2019t deliver results, he gets nothing. If he falls short of a market capitalization milestone, there is no consolation prize. Essentially, the Special Committee and the Board have developed a construct in which Elon does not receive the full compensation or get to keep the associated voting rights under the award until he successfully oversees the creation of what could be the most valuable company in the world \u2014 and remains in a leadership role for the applicable vesting period.\n**Shareholders\u2019 high-stakes decision**\nResponsible, shareholder-first governance ties leadership\u2019s upside to sustained shareholder value, through a transparent and disinterested process. That\u2019s exactly what Tesla has delivered.\nNow, it\u2019s up to shareholders to have the final say.\n_The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune._\n",

I\u2019m a maintenance technician at Tesla in Texas.\nBeing a single mom, it\u2019s hard. My life before Tesla, I wasn\u2019t able to provide for my kids like I wanted to. I only had one bedroom. I had to move back in with my parents, wasn\u2019t able to put them in sports. I wasn\u2019t able to do stuff like that with them.\nNow my life is completely different because of Tesla stock, and I bought this house with my stock and then my daughter was going to have a quincea\u00f1era and quincea\u00f1eras are like weddings. So, we flew out as the kids first time in Mexico. So, it was a family trip. They really enjoyed it.\nMy daughter looked beautiful on her day with quincea\u00f1era. It meant a lot.\nI go on vacations more, sign them all up for sports. And with stock, I was able to do all that.\nMy kids are really happy that I work at Tesla.\nTo fulfill the promise for my kids, it meant the world to me. It was to give them a better life, especially for them. It\u2019s great. My kids are happy. They have their own room, they have their own space.\nTesla\u2019s changed a lot for me and my kids, and because of all this equity and all this stock, I\u2019ve been able to do that.\nAnything is possible here at Tesla. It really is.\nOn October 9, 2025, Tesla updated its website, www.VoteTesla.com.

(\u201cIntel Americas\u201d and together with Intel, the \u201cSellers\u201d), Altera Corporation, at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (\u201cAltera\u201d), and an affiliate of Silver Lake (\u201cPurchaser\u201d), entered into a transaction agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the \u201cTransaction Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Intel would sell a majority interest in its Altera business to the Purchaser (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). \nFollowing the satisfaction of the closing conditions of the Transaction Agreement, the closing of the Transaction was consummated on September 12, 2025, at which time: (i) the Purchaser acquired 51% of the equity interests of Altera for an equity value of approximately $3.3 billion, with Intel retaining the remaining 49% interest; (ii) each of Intel and the Purchaser contributed such equity interests in Altera to a newly formed limited partnership (the \u201cPartnership\u201d); and (iii) Intel and the Purchaser entered into an amended and restated limited partnership agreement (the \u201cLPA\u201d) in substantially the same form as previously described in Intel\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on April 17, 2025 and filed with Intel\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 28, 2025 filed with the SEC on July 24, 2025. The LPA sets forth each party\u2019s rights and responsibilities with respect to the Partnership and respective interests in the Partnership.\nItem 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.\nIntel\u2019s consolidated financial statements for Q3 2025 will reflect Altera\u2019s results from June 29, 2025 through September 11, 2025. Intel will account for its minority investment in Altera under the equity method of accounting upon the closing of the Transaction on September 12, 2025.\nAltera's results as a segment of Intel in the first half of 2025 included gross margin of 55% on revenue of $816 million, with operating expenses of $356 million. Intel has revised its full-year 2025 non-GAAP operating expense target to $16.8 billion (from $17 billion) to reflect the deconsolidation of Altera. Intel\u2019s full-year 2026 operating expense target of $16 billion remains unchanged.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document references targets for non-GAAP operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses refers to non-GAAP R&D and marketing, general and administrative (MG&A). We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance.\nSet forth below are reconciliations of non-GAAP operating expenses to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure, GAAP operating expenses. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the reconciliations should be carefully evaluated. \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n(In Billions; Unaudited) |  |  | Full-Year 2025 |  | Full-Year 2026  \n|  |  | Approximately |  | Approximately  \n|  |  |  |  |   \nGAAP operating expenses |  |  | $ | 21.9 |  |  | $ | 19.0 |   \nAcquisition-related adjustments |  |  | (0.1) |  |  | (0.1) |   \nShare-based compensation |  |  | (2.5) |  |  | (2.9) |   \nRestructuring and other charges |  |  | (2.5) |  |  | \u2014  |   \nNon-GAAP operating expenses |  |  | $ | 16.8 |  |  | $ | 16.0 |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n  \n\n* * *\n  \n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items:\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNon-GAAP adjustment or measure | Definition  | Usefulness to management and investors  \n|  |   \nAcquisition-related adjustments | Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years. | We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.  \nShare-based compensation | Share-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans. | We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments provide comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model, how management currently evaluates core operational performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including in comparison to other peer companies.  \n|  |   \n|  |   \n|  |   \nRestructuring and other charges | Restructuring charges are costs associated with restructuring plans and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include periodic goodwill and asset impairments, and other costs associated with certain non-core activities. | We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.  \n|  |   \nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements as to Intel\u2019s expectations regarding its non-GAAP operating expenses in future periods. Such statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied, including those associated with:\n\u25aathe high level of competition and rapid technological change in our industry;\n\u25aathe significant long-term and inherently risky investments we are making in R&D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return; \n\u25aathe complexities and uncertainties in developing and implementing new semiconductor products and manufacturing process technologies;\n\u25aaour ability to time and scale our capital investments appropriately and successfully secure favorable alternative financing arrangements and government grants;\n\u25aaimplementing new business strategies and investing in new businesses and technologies;\n\u25aachanges in demand for our products;\n\u25aamacroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including geopolitical and trade tensions between the US and China, the impacts of Russia's war on Ukraine, tensions and conflict affecting Israel and the Middle East, and rising tensions between mainland China and Taiwan;\n\u25aathe evolving market for products with AI capabilities;\n\u25aaour complex global supply chain supporting our manufacturing facilities and incorporating external foundries, \n  \n\n* * *\n  \n\nincluding from disruptions, delays, trade tensions and conflicts, or shortages;\n\u25aarecently elevated geopolitical tensions, volatility and uncertainty with respect to international trade policies, including tariffs and export controls, impacting our business, the markets in which we compete and the world economy;\n\u25aaproduct defects, errata and other product issues, particularly as we develop next-generation products and implement next-generation manufacturing process technologies;\n\u25aapotential security vulnerabilities in our products;\n\u25aaincreasing and evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy risks;\n\u25aaIP risks including related litigation and regulatory proceedings;\n\u25aathe need to attract, retain, and motivate key talent;\n\u25aastrategic transactions and investments;\n\u25aasales-related risks, including customer concentration and the use of distributors and other third parties;\n\u25aaour significantly reduced return of capital in recent years;\n\u25aaour debt obligations and our ability to access sources of capital;\n\u25aacomplex and evolving laws and regulations across many jurisdictions;\n\u25aafluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25aachanges in our effective tax rate;\n\u25aacatastrophic events;\n\u25aaenvironmental, health, safety, and product regulations;\n\u25aaour initiatives and new legal requirements with respect to corporate responsibility matters; and\n\u25aaother risks and uncertainties described in this release, our 2024 Form 10-K, our Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, our Q2 2025 Form 10-Q, and our other filings with the SEC.\nGiven these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this release and in other documents we file from time to time with the SEC that disclose risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. \nUnless specifically indicated otherwise, the forward-looking statements in this release do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that have not been completed as of the date of this filing.
