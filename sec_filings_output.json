Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, at settlement, one share of common stock.  \n2. This transaction represents the settlement of restricted stock units in shares of common stock on their scheduled vesting date.  \n3. These shares are held through Mr. Cook's trust.  \n4. Shares withheld by Apple to satisfy tax withholding requirements on vesting of restricted stock units.  \n5. This transaction was made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the reporting person on May 24, 2024.  \n6. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $254.21 to $255.20; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n7. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $255.21 to $256.20; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n8. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $256.21 to $257.20; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n9. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $257.21 to $258.14; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n10. This award was granted on September 25, 2022, for a target number of 199,429 restricted stock units. The award settled on October 1, 2025, applying a percentage of the target number of restricted stock units that was determined based on Apple's total shareholder return (\"TSR\") relative to the other companies in the S&P 500 from the first day of Apple's fiscal year 2023 and ending with the last day of Apple's fiscal year 2025.  \n11. TSR is calculated based on the change in a company's stock price during the performance period, taking into account any dividends paid during that period, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. In accordance with the terms of the award, the beginning value used for calculating TSR is the average closing stock price for the first 20 trading days of the performance period. Apple's beginning value was calculated to be $143.67. Similarly, the ending value used for calculating TSR is the average closing price for the final 20 trading days of the performance period. Apple's ending value was calculated to be $244.54.  \n12. This award provided that if Apple's relative TSR performance was ranked at or above the 85th percentile for companies in the S&P 500 for the performance period, 200% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was ranked at or above the 55th percentile, 100% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was ranked at or above the 25th percentile, 25% of the target number of restricted stock units vest, and if Apple's performance was ranked below the 25th percentile, 0% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was between these levels, the portion of the restricted stock units that vest would be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages.  \n13. Apple's TSR for the three-year performance period was 70.22%, which ranked 162 of the 483 companies that were included in the S&P 500 for the performance period and placed Apple in the 66.60th percentile. Therefore, 277,206 restricted stock units subject to performance requirements vested.  \n**Remarks:**  \n| _/s/ Sam Whittington, Attorney-in-Fact for Timothy D.

Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, at settlement, one share of common stock.  \n2. This transaction represents the settlement of restricted stock units in shares of common stock on their scheduled vesting date.  \n3. Shares withheld by Apple to satisfy tax withholding requirements on vesting of restricted stock units.  \n4. This transaction was made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the reporting person on August 27, 2024.  \n5. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $256.985 to $257.98; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n6. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $257.99 to $258.145; the price reported above reflects the weighted average sale price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected upon request to the SEC staff, Apple, or a security holder of Apple.  \n7. This award was granted on September 25, 2022, for a target number of 66,477 restricted stock units. The award vested on October 1, 2025, applying a percentage of the target number of restricted stock units that was determined based on Apple's total shareholder return (\"TSR\") relative to the other companies in the S&P 500 from the first day of Apple's fiscal year 2023 and ending with the last day of Apple's fiscal year 2025.  \n8. TSR is calculated based on the change in a company's stock price during the performance period, taking into account any dividends paid during that period, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. In accordance with the terms of the award, the beginning value used for calculating TSR is the average closing stock price for the first 20 trading days of the performance period. Apple's beginning value was calculated to be $143.67. Similarly, the ending value used for calculating TSR is the average closing price for the final 20 trading days of the performance period. Apple's ending value was calculated to be $244.54.  \n9. This award provided that if Apple's relative TSR performance was ranked at or above the 85th percentile for companies in the S&P 500 for the performance period, 200% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was ranked at or above the 55th percentile, 100% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was ranked at or above the 25th percentile, 25% of the target number of restricted stock units vest, and if Apple's performance was ranked below the 25th percentile, 0% of the target number of restricted stock units vest. If Apple's performance was between these levels, the portion of the restricted stock units that vest would be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages.  \n10. Apple's TSR for the three-year performance period was 70.22%, which ranked 162 of the 483 companies that were included in the S&P 500 for the performance period and placed Apple in the 66.60th percentile. Therefore, 92,403 restricted stock units subject to performance requirements vested.  \n**Remarks:**  \n| _/s/ Sam Whittington, Attorney-in-Fact for Deirdre O'Brien_ | _10/03/2025_  \n---|---|---  \n| ** Signature of Reporting Person | Date  \nReminder: Report on a separate line for each class of securities beneficially owned directly or indirectly.  \n* If the form is filed by more than one reporting person, _see_ Instruction 4 (b)(v).  \n** Intentional misstatements or omissions of facts constitute Federal Criminal Violations _See_ 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C. 78ff(a).  \nNote: File three copies of this Form, one of which must be manually signed.

This award was granted on September 25, 2022, for a target number of 66,477 restricted stock units. The award vested on October 1, 2025, applying a percentage of the target number of restricted stock units that was determined based on Apple's total shareholder return (\"TSR\") relative to the other companies in the S&amp;P 500 from the first day of Apple's fiscal year 2023 and ending with the last day of Apple's fiscal year 2025.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>8. TSR is calculated based on the change in a company's stock price during the performance period, taking into account any dividends paid during that period, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. In accordance with the terms of the award, the beginning value used for calculating TSR is the average closing stock price for the first 20 trading days of the performance period. Apple's beginning value was calculated to be $143.67. Similarly, the ending value used for calculating TSR is the average closing price for the final 20 trading days of the performance period. Apple's ending value was calculated to be $244.54.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9.

Yet that appears to be how Microsoft responded to a shareholder proposal filed by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). (Microsoft’s answer came in the form of an opposition statement to the proposal, which is on file with the author of this op ed.)\nThe proposal sought basic transparency about the company’s European Security Program and its potential implications for political expression. Instead of engaging, Microsoft waved away the concerns, insisting that it “fail[s] to see” how its activities could chill free speech. That answer is not good enough.\nThe shareholder proposal at issue was straightforward. It asked Microsoft to clarify whether its work in Europe—particularly in partnership with governments and nongovernmental organizations—could expose the company to pressures that would compromise viewpoint neutrality. Shareholders should be told what safeguards exist to prevent European-style speech restrictions from influencing how Microsoft’s technology is employed. The proposal did not ask the company to change its business model or stop protecting customers from cyberattacks. It asked for transparency.\nMicrosoft’s opposition statement seemed designed to shut down the conversation rather than open it. The company appeared to assert that defending against cyberattacks is unrelated to free expression, as though the two issues exist in isolation. But investors know that the line between cybersecurity and speech regulation is not always so neat. Authoritarian regimes, and even democratic governments, sometimes justify censorship under the banner of “safety” or “security.” That is why shareholders are right to ask how Microsoft ensures that its partnerships in Europe do not bleed into viewpoint discrimination.\nThere are reasons for concern. Independent watchdogs have flagged Microsoft for ideological bias in how it evaluates and manages content. Reports from the 1792 Exchange (here and here) and Alliance Defending Freedom’s Viewpoint Diversity Score project (here) point to a pattern of one-sided decision-making that tends to disfavor conservative or dissenting perspectives. Then there are the House Judiciary Committee subpoenas from earlier this year related to apparent corporate involvement, including Microsoft, in censorship of U.S. citizens at the behest of foreign governments. None of this proves that \n* * *\nthe company’s European programs are censorious. But it does demonstrate a track record that justifies scrutiny.\nEqually troubling is Microsoft’s lack of engagement with NCPPR, the shareholder proponent of the proposal. While SEC rules contemplate corporate engagement with proposal proponents, and Microsoft’s own public disclosures tout its commitment to engaging with shareholders, Microsoft never engaged NCPPR on this matter beyond sending its opposition statement. (Elsewhere, Microsoft states: “Effective corporate governance includes regular, constructive conversations with our shareholders to proactively seek shareholder insights and to answer shareholder inquiries.”) If Microsoft is confident its programs pose no risk to free expression, why not walk NCPPR through its reasoning? Why not demonstrate safeguards? Silence only invites suspicion.\nThen there is Microsoft’s reliance on the Global Network Initiative (GNI) as a proxy for accountability. In its opposition statement, the company pointed to its founding membership in GNI as evidence that it takes free expression seriously. Yet shareholders are entitled to ask whether GNI oversight is sufficient. Where are the conservative voices in that process? Does the initiative provide real ideological diversity, or does it reinforce the same perspectives shareholders are already concerned about? All these concerns could ultimately be unfounded, but by not engaging NCPPR directly Microsoft just fosters suspicion.\nTo be clear, no one is disputing the importance of cybersecurity. Protecting citizens and institutions from digital threats is a vital service. Nor is anyone claiming to have definitive proof that Microsoft’s European Security Program will inevitably be repurposed to include censorship. NCPPR would welcome evidence that these fears are unfounded. But the absence of such evidence—combined with the company’s seemingly dismissive response only underscores the need for greater transparency. For example, the proposal specifically references two concerning organizations that tout their commitment to combatting “online hate speech” and “harmful content” directly identified by Microsoft as participating in the program, but Microsoft either ignores the substance of those concerns or ignores the named entity entirely.\nShareholders are not asking for micromanagement of Microsoft’s operations. They are asking for accountability on a matter that goes directly to reputational and financial risk. If Microsoft were found to be complicit in ideologically driven censorship abroad, the fallout could significantly damage shareholder value. As NCPPR notes in its proposal, Facebook lost roughly $134 billion in market value in connection with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Transparency is the best protection against that outcome.\nMicrosoft’s leadership had an opportunity to reassure investors by addressing the proposal seriously. Instead, it chose to minimize the issue and rely on vague appeals to trust. That \n* * *\nmay be expedient in the short term, but it is shortsighted in the long run. A company of Microsoft’s size and influence cannot afford to appear indifferent to legitimate shareholder concerns about free expression.\nThe path forward is simple: engage with critics, demonstrate safeguards, and commit to viewpoint neutrality in all partnerships. If Microsoft is as confident as it claims, it should have nothing to hide. Until it does so, shareholders are right to keep asking hard questions.\n`II.`**The Global Network Initiative: A Quiet Risk for Free Expression?**\nHow companies may be complicit in censoring legitimate speech through their GNI Membership\n(Internal links available at https://dustindevito.substack.com/p/the-global-network-initiative-a-quiet\nMany companies have leaned on their association with the Global Network Initiative (GNI) to reassure stakeholders that their products aren’t being used to censor legitimate speech. On its face, that sounds comforting. After all, who could object to an organization that claims to be a “multistakeholder collaboration to protect freedom of expression and privacy in tech”?\nBut scratch beneath the surface, and a more complicated picture emerges.\n**The Precedent: GARM**\nThis isn’t the first time major corporations have used industry groups as cover. Many companies that claim to champion free speech were previously members of the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM). This “responsible media” group which was publicly aiming to counteract “harmful content” was privately working to censoring mainstream perspectives online.\nGARM’s brand safety framework demonetized or suppressed content it deemed to:\n`·`Spread “hate speech” or “misinformation” \n`·`Discuss “debated social issues in a negative or partisan context” \n`·`“Vilif[y]” individuals based on sexual orientation or gender identity \nIn practice, that meant legitimate speech from mainstream voices, including The Federalist, The Daily Wire, and The New York Post, was flagged and suppressed. GARM members were, at minimum, complicit in this censorship.\n**Enter: The Global Network Initiative (GNI)**\nAlthough the GNI’s framework differs from GARM’s, the outcome is not necessarily distinct. The GNI is governed by its Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy, which, \n* * *\naccording to its website, “provide high-level guidance to the tech industry on how to respect, protect, and advance users’ rights” when governments impose demands or restrictions.\nThese principles are “based on internationally recognized laws and standards for human rights”, including:\n`·`The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) \n`·`The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) \n`·`The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) \nThe application of GNI’s principles is further informed by:\n`·`The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles) \n`·`The Protect, Respect, and Remedy Framework \n`·`OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises \nOn the surface, these documents contain boilerplate human-rights language no one opposes. However, hidden in some of these documents is a catch.\n**The “Other Status” Clause**\nDocuments like the ICCPR and ICESCR prohibit discrimination on grounds such as race, sex, religion, but also “other status.” This vague phrase has, in recent years, been interpreted to include gender identity.\nIn practice, this means speech challenging gender ideology could be construed as discriminatory under GNI’s guiding framework. And if GNI members, like Google or Microsoft, are bound to these interpretations, they may end up censoring lawful, legitimate viewpoints simply because they cut against prevailing progressive norms.\nIt is also worth noting that GNI’s internal Code of Conduct explicitly recognizes gender identity as a protected category.\n**Case Study 19: LGBT Apps in Asia**\nIn case anyone thinks this is hyperbolic, GNI’s own materials illustrate this risk. In its 2018/2019 report, The GNI Principles at Work, GNI highlighted real-world case studies on freedom of expression and privacy challenges in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector, showing how governments and companies interact in ways that affect human rights online. This report uses real-world examples, including censorship requests, surveillance demands, and content removals, to illustrate the application of the Global Network Initiative Principles.\n* * *\nCase Study 19 provides a great example of how GNI Principles could influence the decisions of major tech companies. This case involves governments in Asia requesting the removal of 65 LGBT-related applications, including dating services and community platforms, from app stores. According to the company that received the government request for takedown, it came with a threat of police action and blocking the company from operating in the country.\nTo avoid this scenario, the company applied a step-by-step review for each app:\n`1.`Has this app violated any developer content policies or terms of use? \n`2.`Has the content from this app directly violated any local laws, including obscenity laws? \n`3.`If there are any identified issues, can they be corrected by the app developer? \n`4.`What impact would the removal of the app have on human rights? \nIn short, some apps were removed for violating company policies or obscenity laws, but many remained since the company “identified freedom of expression and association as key issues at stake”.\nGNI frames this case study as a vindication of its Principles and a victory for the LGBT community. While the case study does not explicitly state it, the takedown request contravened international law and the GNI Principles by discriminating against individuals based on their “gender identity” - an area safeguarded under the ICCPR’s and the ICESCR’s “other status” provision.\nThis framing is revealing: GNI recognizes “gender identity” as a real ontological category, the acknowledgement and protection of which is essential to the advancement of human rights. Therefore, when a government restricts transgender content, according to the GNI Principles, this would be discriminatory. Pre-emptively labeling content that challenges the concept of gender identity as discriminatory and in violation of international law contributes to a climate where those who do not believe in modern gender ideology are unable or unwilling to respectfully voice dissent for fear of online, legal, or physical consequences.\n**Following the Money**\nFinally, it’s worth noting that the GNI has received funding from George Soros’ Open Society Foundation and is currently supported by the Ford Foundation, two organizations well known for advancing progressive political causes.\nThis doesn’t automatically discredit the GNI. But it does raise questions about ideological leanings and whether its guidance to members reflects a genuinely neutral defense of expression or the advancement of a particular worldview.\n* * *\n**A Solid Yellow Flag**\nHere’s the concern: as long as the GNI’s framework is grounded in human rights treaties that include the elastic phrase “other status,” there is no guarantee that its members won’t use or be complicit in their services censoring legitimate speech.\nThe risks of using GNI’s framework are not as obvious as the risks of using GARM’s were (for those who read its Brand Safety Framework anyway). But risks are there all the same. So when companies raise their GNI membership as a defense from concerns over censorship, stakeholders should not back off from pressing for clarity.\nMembership in the Global Network Initiative should not reassure us that companies are not censoring speech, but it also should not make us panic. For now, it should raise a solid yellow flag.\nTHE FOREGOING INFORMATION MAY BE DISSEMINATED TO SHAREHOLDERS VIA TELEPHONE, U.S. MAIL, E-MAIL, CERTAIN WEBSITES AND CERTAIN SOCIAL MEDIA VENUES, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS INVESTMENT ADVICE OR AS A SOLICITATION OF AUTHORITY TO VOTE YOUR PROXY. \nTHE COST OF DISSEMINATING THE FOREGOING INFORMATION TO SHAREHOLDERS IS BEING BORNE ENTIRELY BY THE FILERS. \nTHE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN HAS BEEN PREPARED FROM SOURCES BELIEVED RELIABLE BUT IS NOT GUARANTEED BY US AS TO ITS TIMELINESS OR ACCURACY, AND IS NOT A COMPLETE SUMMARY OR STATEMENT OF ALL AVAILABLE DATA.

This “responsible media” group which was publicly aiming to counteract “harmful content” was privately working to censoring mainstream perspectives online.</p>\n<p>GARM’s brand safety framework demonetized or suppressed content it deemed to:</p>\n<p><kbd>·</kbd>Spread “hate speech” or “misinformation” </p>\n<p><kbd>·</kbd>Discuss “debated social issues in a negative or partisan context” </p>\n<p><kbd>·</kbd>“Vilif[y]” individuals based on sexual orientation or gender identity </p>\n<p>In practice, that meant legitimate speech from mainstream voices, including The Federalist, The Daily Wire, and The New York Post, was flagged and suppressed. GARM members were, at minimum, complicit in this censorship.</p>\n<p><b>Enter: The Global Network Initiative (GNI)</b></p>\n<p>Although the GNI’s framework differs from GARM’s, the outcome is not necessarily distinct. The GNI is governed by its Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy, which, </p>\n<hr>\n<p>according to its website, “provide high-level guidance to the tech industry on how to respect, protect, and advance users’ rights” when governments impose demands or restrictions.</p>\n<p>These principles are “based on internationally recognized laws and standards for human rights”, including:</p>\n<p><kbd>·</kbd>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) </p>\n<p><kbd>·</kbd>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) </p>\n<p><kbd>·</kbd>The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) </p>\n<p>The application of GNI’s principles is further informed by:</p>\n<p><kbd>·</kbd>The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles) </p>\n<p><kbd>·</kbd>The Protect, Respect, and Remedy Framework </p>\n<p><kbd>·</kbd>OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises </p>\n<p>On the surface, these documents contain boilerplate human-rights language no one opposes. However, hidden in some of these documents is a catch.</p>\n<p><b>The “Other Status” Clause</b></p>\n<p>Documents like the ICCPR and ICESCR prohibit discrimination on grounds such as race, sex, religion, but also “other status.” This vague phrase has, in recent years, been interpreted to include gender identity.</p>\n<p>In practice, this means speech challenging gender ideology could be construed as discriminatory under GNI’s guiding framework. And if GNI members, like Google or Microsoft, are bound to these interpretations, they may end up censoring lawful, legitimate viewpoints simply because they cut against prevailing progressive norms.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that GNI’s internal Code of Conduct explicitly recognizes gender identity as a protected category.</p>\n<p><b>Case Study 19: LGBT Apps in Asia</b></p>\n<p>In case anyone thinks this is hyperbolic, GNI’s own materials illustrate this risk. In its 2018/2019 report, The GNI Principles at Work, GNI highlighted real-world case studies on freedom of expression and privacy challenges in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector, showing how governments and companies interact in ways that affect human rights online. This report uses real-world examples, including censorship requests, surveillance demands, and content removals, to illustrate the application of the Global Network Initiative Principles.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Case Study 19 provides a great example of how GNI Principles could influence the decisions of major tech companies. This case involves governments in Asia requesting the removal of 65 LGBT-related applications, including dating services and community platforms, from app stores. According to the company that received the government request for takedown, it came with a threat of police action and blocking the company from operating in the country.</p>\n<p>To avoid this scenario, the company applied a step-by-step review for each app:</p>\n<p><kbd>1.</kbd>Has this app violated any developer content policies or terms of use? </p>\n<p><kbd>2.</kbd>Has the content from this app directly violated any local laws, including obscenity laws? </p>\n<p><kbd>3.</kbd>If there are any identified issues, can they be corrected by the app developer? </p>\n<p><kbd>4.</kbd>What impact would the removal of the app have on human rights? </p>\n<p>In short, some apps were removed for violating company policies or obscenity laws, but many remained since the company “identified freedom of expression and association as key issues at stake”.</p>\n<p>GNI frames this case study as a vindication of its Principles and a victory for the LGBT community. While the case study does not explicitly state it, the takedown request contravened international law and the GNI Principles by discriminating against individuals based on their “gender identity” - an area safeguarded under the ICCPR’s and the ICESCR’s “other status” provision.</p>\n<p>This framing is revealing: GNI recognizes “gender identity” as a real ontological category, the acknowledgement and protection of which is essential to the advancement of human rights. Therefore, when a government restricts transgender content, according to the GNI Principles, this would be discriminatory. Pre-emptively labeling content that challenges the concept of gender identity as discriminatory and in violation of international law contributes to a climate where those who do not believe in modern gender ideology are unable or unwilling to respectfully voice dissent for fear of online, legal, or physical consequences.</p>\n<p><b>Following the Money</b></p>\n<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that the GNI has received funding from George Soros’ Open Society Foundation and is currently supported by the Ford Foundation, two organizations well known for advancing progressive political causes.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t automatically discredit the GNI. But it does raise questions about ideological leanings and whether its guidance to members reflects a genuinely neutral defense of expression or the advancement of a particular worldview.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><b>A Solid Yellow Flag</b></p>\n<p>Here’s the concern: as long as the GNI’s framework is grounded in human rights treaties that include the elastic phrase “other status,” there is no guarantee that its members won’t use or be complicit in their services censoring legitimate speech.</p>\n<p>The risks of using GNI’s framework are not as obvious as the risks of using GARM’s were (for those who read its Brand Safety Framework anyway). But risks are there all the same. So when companies raise their GNI membership as a defense from concerns over censorship, stakeholders should not back off from pressing for clarity.</p>\n<p>Membership in the Global Network Initiative should not reassure us that companies are not censoring speech, but it also should not make us panic. For now, it should raise a solid yellow flag.</p>\n<p>THE FOREGOING INFORMATION MAY BE DISSEMINATED TO SHAREHOLDERS VIA  TELEPHONE, U.S. MAIL, E-MAIL, CERTAIN WEBSITES AND CERTAIN SOCIAL  MEDIA VENUES, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS INVESTMENT ADVICE OR  AS A SOLICITATION OF AUTHORITY TO VOTE YOUR PROXY. </p>\n<p>THE COST OF DISSEMINATING THE FOREGOING INFORMATION TO SHAREHOLDERS IS BEING BORNE ENTIRELY BY THE FILERS. </p>\n<p>THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN HAS BEEN PREPARED FROM SOURCES  BELIEVED RELIABLE BUT IS NOT GUARANTEED BY US AS TO ITS TIMELINESS OR  ACCURACY, AND IS NOT A COMPLETE SUMMARY OR STATEMENT OF ALL  AVAILABLE DATA.

On July 1, 2025, 59 Microsoft shareholders, collectively representing more than $80 million in MSFT shares, filed a shareholder proposal calling on Microsoft to publish a report assessing the effectiveness of its Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) processes. It requests that Microsoft evaluate whether its AI and cloud technologies are being misused by customers, such as military entities, to commit human rights abuses or violations of international hu-manitarian law. WHY? On September 25, 2025, The Guardian reported that Microsoft had restricted Israeli military use of certain technol-ogies after journalistic investigations revealed they had been employed in mass surveillance of Palestinians. This followed an earlier Company review, which purportedly found its Azure and AI technologies had not been used in ways that breached Microsoft's terms of service or AI Code of Conduct. The decision to act only after persistent media reporting and employee and public outcry illustrates that Microsoft's HRDD processes did not identify or address significant human rights risks, revealing gaps in oversight and review. This isn't an isolated case. There is a pattern of allegations about Microsoft's complicity in human rights violations in China, Saudi Arabia, and the USA. This suggests systemic issues with Microsoft's HRDD practices.In 2023, Foley Hoag conducted a Human Rights Impact Assessment which recommended that Microsoft assess its military contracts. There has been no public confirmation that Microsoft has done this. These gaps in oversight and review of its due diligence processes pose material risks for investors:? Financial Risk: Potential loss of revenue or increased cost of capital, potential portfolio impacts for investors due to S&P 500 weighting.? Legal and Regulatory Risk: Potential financial liability for the Company under EU laws; potential criminal liability for the Company and its executives for complicity in human rights violations.? Operational Risk: Controversy impacts key talent recruitment and retention; distracts senior management from core business.? Reputational Risks: Microsoft named by UN Special Rapporteur as profiting from, and therefore complicit in, war crimes and genocide in Gaza. Risk of eroding public and customer trust. CONCLUSIONMicrosoft acknowledges that client category and geographic location impact likelihood of product misuse and hu-man rights impacts. Yet it has not demonstrably, consistently translated this awareness into systematic, heightened HRDD. A stream of accusations and the Company's recent decision to cancel one of its contracts with the Israeli military strongly suggest that Microsoft's current, largely reactive measures to allegations of human rights abuses by customers are inadequate. Without a comprehensive, systematic approach to due diligence, shareholders remain exposed to significant material, financial, legal & regulatory, operational, and reputational risks. Supporting the 2025 shareholder resolution is therefore prudent.\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-001.jpg)\nRisky Business: Microsoft has a due diligence problem.

The proposal calls on Microsoft to publish a report assessing the effectiveness of its human rights due diligence (HRDD) processes. It requests that Microsoft evaluate whether its AI and cloud technologies are being misused by customers, such as military entities, to commit human rights abuses or violations of international humanitarian law. This briefing outlines the various allegations which raise questions about the Company's HRDD practices and the adequacy of existing external reviews, and demonstrates why supporting the resolution is necessary to protect shareholder value. KEY ISSUES ? Microsoft recognizes that certain products, customers, and jurisdictions carry elevated risk, but journalistic investigations suggest ineffective HRDD.? 2023 Human Rights Impact Assessment recommended that Microsoft assess its military contracts. No public confirmation that this has been done.? A pattern of allegations about complicity in human rights violations in Israel, China, Saudi Arabia, and the USA. This suggests systemic issues with Microsoft's HRDD practices.? Microsoft's investigations are reactive, narrow, and non-transparent. ? Its recent decision to block Israeli surveillance use confirms the inadequacy of existing processes.MATERIAL RISKS FOR MICROSOFT AND SHAREHOLDERS? Financial Risk: Potential loss of revenue or increased cost of capital, potential portfolio impacts for investors due to S&P 500 weighting.? Legal and Regulatory Risk: Potential financial liability for the Company under EU laws; potential criminal liability for the Company and its executives for complicity in human rights violations.? Operational Risk: Controversy impacts key talent recruitment and retention; distracts senior management from core business.? Reputational Risks: Microsoft named by UN Special Rapporteur as profiting from, and therefore complicit in, war crimes and genocide in Gaza.2 Risk of eroding public and customer trust.On September 25, 2025, The Guardian reported that Microsoft had restricted Israeli military use of certain technol-ogies after journalistic investigations revealed they had been employed in mass surveillance of Palestinians.1 This followed an earlier Company review, which found that its Azure and AI technologies had not been used in ways that breached Microsoft's terms of service or AI Code of Conduct. The decision to act only after persistent media report-ing and employee and public outcry illustrates that Microsoft's HRDD processes did not identify or address signifi-cant human rights risks, revealing gaps in oversight and review. This poses material risks for investors.2\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-003.jpg)\n3MICROSOFT'S HRDD IS INADEQUATEThe UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (\"UNGPs\")3 constitute the global authoritative framework outlining human rights responsibilities of states and businesses, and expectations are heightened for companies with business activities in conflict-affected and high- risk areas. Companies are expected to take all reasonable steps to ensure their products and services - including the deployment of such technologies by customers - are not used to violate human rights. To meet these obligations, companies should conduct HRDD to identify, prevent, miti-gate, and account for adverse human rights impacts, and to transparently report on the effectiveness of such HRDD. Microsoft states it conducts ongoing HRDD across its value chain, in line with its obligations under the UNGPs,4 but it provides insufficient information about the effectiveness of its HRDD processes related to customer end use.5Despite Microsoft's policies suggesting that the Company undertakes proactive and ongoing due diligence, potential misuse of its products has been uncovered not by internal HRDD but by investigative journalism. Foley Hoag's human rights impact assessment (\"HRIA\") highlighted that \"Microsoft describes its human rights management as \"hub-and-spoke,\" intended to empower and support front line personnel to identify and address legal and policy issues, including human rights issues. To that end, Microsoft's teams do not typically follow a formal set of processes and protocols to identify and assess potential human rights risks.\"6 Foley Hoag noted that \"[c]onsequently, Microsoft has few internal policies and procedures that could be used by personnel as guidance to establish a standardized process for the identification, assessment, and elevation of human rights risks.\"7Beyond failures of human rights due diligence, Microsoft's conduct also raises questions about compliance with its primary Codes of Conduct in the Microsoft Services Agreement. These codes prohibit illegal activity and any behavior that harms or threatens to harm others, particularly children. Continued contracts with state and non-state actors implicated in systematic human rights abuses and violations, including those contravening international humanitarian law, represent not only process failures in HRDD but also negligence in enforcing the company's basic user policies and standards.Further, the Company's actions may constitute Business and Human Rights standards norms breaches. Recently issued guidance by the Church of England and a consortium of institutional investors and human rights experts categorizes cases of \"Company Breaches of Norms\" as substantive failures involving direct or enabling complicity in human rights violations.8 According to their guidance, if Microsoft conducts ongoing business operations with nation states involved in numerous and continual human rights violations, this could constitute being categorized as a \"Norms Breach Company\", designated at the highest level of harm in terms of severity and irreversibility, exposing the Company to heightened shareholder scrutiny and potential exclusion from investment portfolios.The cumulative effect, despite the Company's claims to the contrary, is a risk management approach that is reac-tive and that does not assure investors or the public that high-risk client relationships are adequately assessed and monitored. This approach increases reputational, regulatory, and operational risks.\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-004.jpg)\n4HIGH-RISK CLIENTS AND JURISDICTIONS Microsoft recognizes that the nature and specific location of a customer can amplify risks, independently of the product offered requiring elevated scrutiny. Its Responsible AI Framework, for example, imposes limited access restrictions on certain products such as facial recognition tools when sold to government agencies.9 The Company's Global Human Rights Statement reaffirms its commitment to the UNGPs and emphasizes heightened due diligence for certain countries and HRIAs at both a product and corporate level.10 However, given repeated allegations of human rights issues, implementation appears to be uneven, particularly with respect to products such as Azure cloud storage, whose potential of being deployed in a manner harmful to people is less obvious than that of other AI tools, such as facial recognition. 2023 HRIA RECOMMENDED AN ASSESSMENT OF MICROSOFT'S MILITARY CONTRACTSFoley Hoag was commissioned by Microsoft (in response to a shareholder resolution) to conduct an independent HRIA, focused on Microsoft's licensing of cloud services (including those incorporating AI) to U.S. law enforcement (including agencies involved in policing and prisons) and immigration enforcement agencies.11 While the 2023 HRIA found no direct evidence that Microsoft's products and services caused or contributed to human rights harms, Foley Hoag made 23 recommendations. They included that the Company should \"consider conducting theme-specific due diligence exercises or additional HRIAs focused on: [...]assessing the company's commercial relationships with military agencies and their impacts on BIPOC and other vulnerable communities...\"12There is no public disclosure confirming that an HRIA has been done for military clients. These gaps underscore that HRDD practices (especially for high-risk client categories such as military agencies) are not sufficiently visible to investors or stakeholders.\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-005.jpg)\n5A PATTERN OF CONTROVERSY AND QUESTIONS ABOUT DUE DILIGENCEDespite the Company's claims that it carries out ongoing and proactive due diligence, there is a pattern of allega-tions over many years of involvement in facilitating civil and human rights abuses and human rights violations. This raises significant concerns for investors about the Company's oversight and HRDD processes.5CHINA: ENABLING MASS SURVEILLANCE IN XINJIANGIn September 2025 Associated Press13 reported that Microsoft provided cloud services to Landasoft, a Chinese surveillance company implicated in the repression of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. According to the report, Landasoft registered accounts on Microsoft Azure in 2018 seeking to expand cloud offerings to police clients. Microsoft con-firmed that Landasoft accessed Azure through a self-service portal, which was retired in 2021, and stated that any data related to Landasoft was deleted. While factually accurate, the self-service framing does not remove Microsoft's responsibility under its own human rights policies: China represents a high-risk environment where, according to Microsoft's own policies, \"heightened due diligence\" should be carried out. Allowing a company with ties to repressive policing to access cloud services without proactive assessment raises questions about Microsoft's HRDD.In another example, Microsoft provided AI and cloud computing services and mentorship to Chinese startups, through its incubator program.14 After graduating the program, some companies have subsequently partnered with the Xinjiang police where their surveillance tools and support have reportedly been used by the Chinese government in its brutal oppression of the Uyghur population.15SAUDI ARABIA: CONCERNS OVER FACILITATING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSAssessments from Freedom House and the U.S. State Department show that Saudi Arabia is a high-risk human rights environment.16 In 2023, Human Rights Watch called on Microsoft to suspend its investment in a new cloud data center region in Saudi Arabia until it can clearly demonstrate how it will mitigate the risk of facilitating serious human rights violations.17 The concern arises from the potential for Saudi authorities to obtain access to data stored in Microsoft's cloud data center, posing threats to human rights and privacy. In 2024 a shareholder resolution calling for a HRIA about the data center in Saudi Arabia and other countries with human rights concerns was filed by Ek? and received a third of the shareholder vote.18ISRAEL: FACILITATING MASS SURVEILLANCE OF CIVILIANS In 2019, Microsoft invested in AnyVision which faced scrutiny following media reports that its technology was used to surveil Palestinians who lived in the occupied West Bank.19 Microsoft hired a team from Covington & Burling and former US AG Eric Holder to investigate the claims.5\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-006.jpg)\n6Microsoft decided to divest from AnyVision despite investigation finding that the AnyVision technology was not used in mass surveillance.In 2025 Microsoft faced allegations that its Azure cloud and AI tools were used by the Israeli Military to carry out mass surveillance and cause civilian harm - see below for further details. UNITED STATES: HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRACTSIn response to shareholder concerns, Microsoft commissioned a HRIA conducted by the law firm Foley Hoag LLP. The assessment, published in June 2023, examined the impact of Microsoft's cloud and artificial intelligence technologies licensed to U.S. federal and state law enforcement and immigration enforcement agencies. The HRIA found that while Microsoft has robust human rights policies, there are areas where the company can improve, particularly regarding its consulting services provided to law enforcement agencies, and offered recommendations on improving HRDD. MASS SURVEILLANCE OF CIVILIANS BY ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE AGENCYMicrosoft's recent announcement that it found \"evidence that supports\" Israel's Unit 8200 used its technologies in violation of the terms of service highlight weaknesses in the Company's HRDD and internal and external reviews.In early 2025, The Guardian20 and the Associated Press21 reported that Israel's military relied on Microsoft technology during its Gaza offensive, raising concerns that Azure cloud and AI tools could have been used in operations potentially posing risks to civilians. In response, Microsoft commissioned an internal review and engaged an external firm to undertake additional fact-finding. In May 2025, Microsoft announced that the review concluded there was \"no evidence that Microsoft's Azure and AI technologies, or any of our other software, have been used to harm people or that IMOD has failed to comply with our terms of service or our AI Code of Conduct.\"22 However, the review's method-ology, scope, full final report, or even the name of the external law firm were not disclosed. The absence of key information including which staff were consulted and how much reliance was placed on staff assurances, what data was examined, and how civilian harm was defined and assessed, makes it difficult to evaluate the adequacy of the review. Further reporting from the Guardian and others also raises questions about the robustness of that review. In August 2025, a joint investigation by The Guardian,23 +972 Magazine,24 and Local Call25 alleged that Unit 8200, an Israeli military intelligence unit, had used Microsoft's Azure cloud to store roughly 200 million hours of Palestinian phone call recordings from Gaza and the West Bank. The data, described as stored in \"a customized and segregated area within Azure,\" including data centers in the Netherlands and Ireland,26 was reportedly used to inform military targeting decisions, including operations that posed risks to civilians. \n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-007.jpg)\n7The investigation, based on internal Microsoft documents and interviews with 11 sources from the Company and Israeli military intelligence, alleged that some Microsoft engineers were aware the data included raw intelligence, while Israel-based staff, including Unit 8200 alumni, appeared to understand the military objectives. The fact that evidence existed internally but was unavailable to the first review casts serious doubt on the adequacy of that assessment.Following this reporting, Microsoft commissioned a second external review, to be led by Covington & Burling LLP with independent consultancy assistance, to examine allegations of mass surveillance that could constitute a breach of its Terms of Service.27 Microsoft has not confirmed to date whether Covington & Burling was also the external firm involved in the first review. Microsoft has a long-standing commercial relationship with Covington & Burling LLP, and Microsoft's Vice Chair and President, Brad Smith, who oversees Microsoft's implementation of its human rights commitments,28 was once a partner at the law firm29 creating at least perception of a conflict of interest.Microsoft subsequently announced on September 25, 2025, that it would cancel the specific contract with the Israeli military while continuing to work with them as a client. While this demonstrates that credible risks of real-world harm existed and required Microsoft to take corrective action, it also confirms that the first review failed to identify them. After the cancellation, Brad Smith sent a note to staff emphasizing that the second review \"...had not accessed any customer data but its findings were based on a review of internal Microsoft documents, emails and messages between staff\"30 and credited the Guardian reporting for bringing to light \"information we could not access in light of our customer privacy commitments.\"31 However, the Guardian's reporting relied in part on internal Microsoft documents indicating that information needed to assess risk was available internally during the first review but was not examined. The second review appeared to focus narrowly on whether cloud storage was used for mass surveillance, and seems not to explicitly address allegations that the stored data was used in military operations potentially harmful to civilians.32 The August 2025 reporting by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call highlighted these risks and prompted the second review, yet Microsoft treats these allegations as distinct from those addressed by the first re-view. In reality, they are the same category of risks, demonstrating that the first review did not, at minimum, examine the internal documents later cited by the investigative reporting. Given that Microsoft has revised its assessment of violation of its terms of service, it is unclear why the allegations of civilian-harm are not also being revisited.The sequence of events highlights weaknesses in and unresolved questions about Microsoft's HRDD, oversight, review processes, and transparency when it comes to high-risk client relationships. The prudent course of action at this time is to formally assess the effectiveness of Microsoft's HRDD practices in preventing, identifying, and addressing customer misuse of Microsoft AI and cloud products or services that violate human rights or international humanitarian law.The Guardian, August 6, 2025+972 Magazine, August 6, 2025\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-008.jpg)\n8ADEQUACY OF EXISTING EXTERNAL INVESTIGATIONSMicrosoft's response to these allegations has followed a familiar pattern: commissioning external reviews that conclude with \"no evidence\" of misuse, but new allegations continue to arise. In 2020, Covington & Burling LLP found no breach in relation to Microsoft's investment in the Israeli surveillance firm AnyVision although the Company subsequently divested. In 2023, the Foley Hoag HRIA reached similar no evidence of harm findings regarding Microsoft's services and products by US law enforcement agencies. The first review into Israeli military contracts in early 2025 repeated this formula, concluding that Azure and AI technologies had not been used to harm civilians or violate Microsoft's terms of services. This pattern suggests structural deficiencies in Microsoft's HRDD including insufficient mechanisms to assess real-world impacts of high-risk clients, and raise questions about the scope and adequacy of external reviews. They are typically narrow in scope, and sometimes constrained by client agreements or Terms of Service that can limit disclosure, as seen in the Foley Hoag HRIA. Their opacity is heightened when methodologies, terms of reference, or full reports are withheld, making it impossible to assess rigor or scope, or where their conclusions amount to mere blanket statements (e.g., \"found no evidence\"), which provide little basis for stakeholders or investors to evaluate whether underlying risks have been materially reduced.Microsoft's deference to Terms of Service and customer privacy commitments to define what can be investigated reflects a choice that limits its own ability to assess potential human rights abuses using their products by high-risk clients.33 Even when investigative reporting identifies potential misuse, internal reviews may be constrained from fully examining the facts, creating structural gaps in HRDD.Investors should support an independent review of Microsoft's HRDD to ensure high-risk client use is properly assessed and potential human rights risks are effectively mitigated.\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-009.jpg)\n9MATERIAL RISKS FOR INVESTORSThe recurring nature of these allegations suggests systemic issues with Microsoft's HRDD practices especially when it comes to high-risk clients such as military agencies. Inadequate HRDD exposes Microsoft to material, legal, operational, and reputational risks.Microsoft's potential complicity in international crimes in Gaza has resulted in outspoken opposition from its own employees,34 a boycott and divestment campaign against the Company,35 severe reputational damage that may harm long-term shareholder value, and risks exposing the company to legal and regulatory penalties.? FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RISK: ? Enterprises, governments, and other large customers may avoid association with companies under hu-man-rights or surveillance controversy. Loss of business, or demands for contract renegotiation and higher indemnification, can directly reduce revenue and margins. The UN Human Rights Council has highlighted the business risks of corporate complicity in conflict-affected areas.36? Meeting the criteria of a \"Norms Breach Company\" of international human rights standards, can expose the Company to shareholder action, engagement escalation, or exclusion from investment portfolios, which in turn can increase the Company's cost of capital.37? LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK: If voice recordings obtained through mass surveillance of civilians are stored in any Microsoft Data Centers located in Ireland or the Netherlands, this will likely breach the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. If any of this data involves calls between people in the EU and in the West Bank or Gaza, this is likely an additional breach of the rights of EU citizens. The collection of this data does not appear to fall within any of the six legal grounds that allow for collection defined under the regulation. It is likely that com-plaints will be lodged with the EU lead's data protection authority - Ireland's Data Protection Commission - calling on the agency to investigate.The Dutch government announced they would \"request further investigation\", and if there are serious indica-tions of criminal offences, then the public prosecutor's office could decide to initiate legal proceedings.38It is also possible that efforts will be made to hold the company and/or its executives responsible in the courts if there is evidence of complicity in human rights violations. Universal jurisdiction, the principle that certain grave crimes (e.g., genocide, crimes against humanity) can be prosecuted irrespective of where they were committed or the nationality of perpetrators or victims, is increasingly being tested in the context of corporate complicity in human rights violations. This presents heightened legal and reputational risk for companies and their investors. Substantiated allegations such as misuse of cloud services, GDPR violations, or human rights harms could also increase perceived risk, raising equity risk premiums and pushing up the cost of debt as lenders incorporate litigation and regulatory exposure into credit spreads.399\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-010.jpg)\n10? OPERATIONAL RISK: Involvement in controversial partnerships that attract the attention of the media, civil society, and regulators can distract senior management from Microsoft's core business objectives. Employee protests and activism over controversial contracts can depress morale, erode trust in management, increase quits, and slow delivery in mission-critical teams.42 At a time when tech companies are competing intensely for key employees to win the competitive race on AI, Microsoft can ill afford to undermine its ability to acquire and retain top talent. ? REPUTATIONAL RISK: In June 2025, United Nations Special Rapporteur, Francesca Albanese, presented a new report - \"From economy of occupation to economy of genocide\"- to the United Nations' Human Rights Coun-cil, which names companies she says are profiting from, and therefore complicit in, war crimes and genocide in Gaza.43 She includes Microsoft, noting its decades-long involvement in Israel and the extensive access Micro-soft grants the Israeli government to its AI technologies, data analytics, and surveillance.44 Microsoft is facing repeated allegations of its products being used to facilitate human rights violations, which is drawing internal45 and external criticism46 which is itself continuously generating headlines which damage the company's brand and can erode public and customer trust. ? SYSTEMIC RISK: Microsoft is the second largest stock weights in the S&P 500, at ~6.4%,47 with a market capital-ization of roughly USD 3.8 trillion.48 When a company of this size suffers a reputational or legal shock, the effects ripple through index-tracking portfolios and pension funds. Exposure to Microsoft is often unavoidable for in-vestors. For diversified investors and \"universal owners,\" these portfolio-level impacts of the Company's actions make it essential to monitor potential risks associated with Microsoft's operations and public perception. Addressing the costs of human rights violations may help protect shareholders from economy-wide risks, including those resulting from human rights abuses potentially associated with Microsoft's products. Market performance, and, accordingly, the long-term performance of diversified portfolios, depends on the health of the economy, which can be undermined when companies' activities create social and environmental costs that drag on GDP.49 Conflict and human rights violations can generate spillover effects that disrupt trade, investment, and financial markets beyond local economies.50 Reports indicate that Microsoft's technologies have been linked to LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALLEGED COMPLICITY IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMESLundin Case (Sweden)On 11 November 2021, the Swedish public prosecutor formally charged the chief executive of Lundin Energy (formerly Lundin Petroleum) and the chairman of the Board for aiding and abetting war crimes that occurred between 1999 and 2003 in Sudan, now South Sudan. Both deny the allegations. The trial started on 5 September 2023 and the concluding pleas will be delivered in February and March 2026.40Lafarge Case (France)French cement company Lafarge is facing charges of complicity in crimes against humanity, and financing terrorism and violating an embargo.41 Between 2013 and 2014, Lafarge allegedly made payments to terrorist groups, including ISIS, to continue operations at its Syrian cement plant amidst the civil war.10\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-011.jpg)\n11military targeting and surveillance activities in Gaza, contributing to the destruction of infrastructure, the displacement of communities, and loss of life, factors that depress economic productivity and slow recovery. These dynamics not only weaken local economies but can ripple globally, heightening legal, reputational, and systemic risks, and threatening the long-term returns of diversified investors.51Shareholders need to be assured that the Company's strategy is not mispricing and undervaluing the risks associat-ed with continuing business with customers in violation of the Company's standards and policies. Continuing contracts that bear numerous and compounding material risks and costs to the Company should be weighed against the revenue gained by such contracts and the costs of adequate and efficient due diligence. Negligence to address these due diligence failures raises numerous issues related to the Company's Duty of Care to shareholders. Robust due diligence practices are essential to mitigate these risks. Given repeated allegations, an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's HRDD processes and practices is needed. By taking proactive steps, Microsoft can safeguard its reputation, ensure compliance with international standards, and maintain investor confidence.CONCLUSIONMicrosoft acknowledges that client category and geographic location impact likelihood of product misuse and human rights impacts. Yet it has not demonstrably consistently translated this awareness into systematic, heightened HRDD. External assessments, such as the Foley Hoag HRIA, have explicitly recommended assessing the company's relationship with military agencies and working with stakeholders to discuss priorities for future HRDD but the company has not publicly committed to fully implementing these recommendations. A stream of accusa-tions and the Company's recent decision to cancel one of its contracts with the Israeli military strongly suggest that Microsoft's current, largely reactive measures to allegations of human rights abuses by customers are inadequate. Without a comprehensive, systematic approach to due diligence, shareholders remain exposed to significant material, financial, legal & regulatory, and reputational risks. Supporting the 2025 shareholder resolution is therefore prudent.\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000121465925015002/image-012.jpg)\n12DISCLAIMERNone of Ek?, Investor Advocates for Social Justice (IASJ), Center for Middle East Investment (CMEI), nor Racial Justice Investing (RJI) are investment or financial advisors, and do not make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in any particular company or investment fund or vehicle.

My name is Aaron Acosta, and on behalf of lead proponents Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary Charitable Trust and the Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary and **57 additional co-filers** , we respectfully request your support for our shareholder proposal at Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), which can be found here. We would welcome the opportunity to meet to discuss the proposal in greater detail. \nThe proposal asks Microsoft to publish a report, assessing the effectiveness of its human rights due diligence (“HRDD”) processes in preventing, identifying, and addressing customer misuse of Microsoft artificial intelligence (“AI”) and cloud products or services that violates human rights or international humanitarian law. You can find our exempt solicitation, which explains the material risks, here.\nWe believe support for this shareholder resolution is warranted because Microsoft’s current HRDD appears insufficient in preventing, identifying, and addressing customer misuse of its technologies and services. This was highlighted most recently by the Company’s decision to terminate one of its contracts with the Israeli military, following a journalistic investigation that revealed its technologies had been employed in mass surveillance of Palestinians. Notably, it was the journalistic investigation, not Microsoft’s HRDD, that brought to light the customer misuse. Our exempt solicitation shows that this example of ineffective HRDD is just one of many cases in which the Company’s technologies and services have been used to violate human rights and international humanitarian law, underscoring the importance of the requested report on the effectiveness of Microsoft’s HRDD.\nIneffective HRDD exposes investors to material risks, including:\n| ● |  **Financial Risk** : potential loss of revenue or increased cost of capital, potential portfolio impacts for investors due to S&P 500 weighting.  \n---|---|---  \n| ● |  **Legal and Regulatory Risk** : potential financial liability for the Company under EU laws; potential criminal liability for the Company and its executives for complicity in human rights violations.  \n---|---|---  \n| ● |  **Operational Risk** : negative impacts on key talent recruitment and retention; distractions of senior management from core business.  \n---|---|---  \n| ● |  **Reputational Risks** : Microsoft named by UN Special Rapporteur as profiting from, and therefore complicit in, war crimes and genocide in Gaza. Risk of eroding public and customer trust.  \n---|---|---  \nWe would welcome the opportunity to discuss the shareholder resolution with you. Thank you for your time and attention, and we look forward to hearing from you.\nBest Regards,\nAaron\n",

On July 1, 2025, 59 Microsoft shareholders, collectively representing more than $80 million in MSFT shares, filed a shareholder proposal calling on Microsoft to publish a report assessing the effectiveness of its Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) processes. It requests that Microsoft evaluate whether its AI and cloud technologies are being misused by customers, such as military entities, to commit human rights abuses or violations of international hu-manitarian law. WHY? On September 25, 2025, The Guardian reported that Microsoft had restricted Israeli military use of certain technol-ogies after journalistic investigations revealed they had been employed in mass surveillance of Palestinians. This followed an earlier Company review, which purportedly found its Azure and AI technologies had not been used in ways that breached Microsoft's terms of service or AI Code of Conduct. The decision to act only after persistent media reporting and employee and public outcry illustrates that Microsoft's HRDD processes did not identify or address significant human rights risks, revealing gaps in oversight and review. This isn't an isolated case. There is a pattern of allegations about Microsoft's complicity in human rights violations in China, Saudi Arabia, and the USA. This suggests systemic issues with Microsoft's HRDD practices.In 2023, Foley Hoag conducted a Human Rights Impact Assessment which recommended that Microsoft assess its military contracts. There has been no public confirmation that Microsoft has done this. These gaps in oversight and review of its due diligence processes pose material risks for investors:? Financial Risk: Potential loss of revenue or increased cost of capital, potential portfolio impacts                 for investors due to S&amp;P 500 weighting.? Legal and Regulatory Risk: Potential financial liability for the Company under EU laws; potential            criminal liability for the Company and its executives for complicity in human rights violations.? Operational Risk: Controversy impacts key talent recruitment and retention; distracts senior                 management from core business.? Reputational Risks: Microsoft named by UN Special Rapporteur as profiting from, and therefore           complicit in, war crimes and genocide in Gaza. Risk of eroding public and customer trust. CONCLUSIONMicrosoft acknowledges that client category and geographic location impact likelihood of product misuse and hu-man rights impacts. Yet it has not demonstrably, consistently translated this awareness into systematic, heightened HRDD. A stream of accusations and the Company's recent decision to cancel one of its contracts with the Israeli military strongly suggest that Microsoft's current, largely reactive measures to allegations of human rights abuses by customers are inadequate. Without a comprehensive, systematic approach to due diligence, shareholders remain exposed to significant material, financial, legal &amp; regulatory, operational, and reputational risks. Supporting the 2025 shareholder resolution is therefore prudent.</p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 1 -->\n    <div><table><tbody><tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td></td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr></tbody></table></div>\n    <div><table><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n    <!-- Field: /Page -->\n\n<img src=\"image-001.jpg\">\n\n<p>Risky Business: Microsoft has a due diligence problem.

This briefing outlines the various allegations which raise questions about the Company's HRDD practices and the adequacy of existing external reviews, and demonstrates why supporting the resolution is necessary to protect shareholder value. KEY ISSUES ? Microsoft recognizes that certain products, customers, and jurisdictions carry elevated risk, but journalistic investigations suggest ineffective HRDD.? 2023 Human Rights Impact Assessment recommended that Microsoft assess its military contracts. No public confirmation that this has been done.? A pattern of allegations about complicity in human rights violations in Israel, China, Saudi Arabia, and the USA. This suggests systemic issues with Microsoft's HRDD practices.? Microsoft's investigations are reactive, narrow, and non-transparent. ? Its recent decision to block Israeli surveillance use confirms the inadequacy of existing processes.MATERIAL RISKS FOR MICROSOFT AND SHAREHOLDERS? Financial Risk: Potential loss of revenue or increased cost of capital, potential portfolio impacts for investors due to S&amp;P 500 weighting.? Legal and Regulatory Risk: Potential financial liability for the Company under EU laws; potential criminal liability for the Company and its executives for complicity in human rights violations.? Operational Risk: Controversy impacts key talent recruitment and retention; distracts senior management from core business.? Reputational Risks: Microsoft named by UN Special Rapporteur as profiting from, and therefore complicit in, war crimes and genocide in Gaza.2 Risk of eroding public and customer trust.On September 25, 2025, The Guardian reported that Microsoft had restricted Israeli military use of certain technol-ogies after journalistic investigations revealed they had been employed in mass surveillance of Palestinians.1 This followed an earlier Company review, which found that its Azure and AI technologies had not been used in ways that breached Microsoft's terms of service or AI Code of Conduct. The decision to act only after persistent media report-ing and employee and public outcry illustrates that Microsoft's HRDD processes did not identify or address signifi-cant human rights risks, revealing gaps in oversight and review. This poses material risks for investors.2</p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 3 -->\n<div>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n<tr>\n          <td> </td>\n          <td></td>\n          <td> </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n</table>\n    </div>\n<!-- Field: /Page --><img src=\"image-003.jpg\">\n\n<p>3MICROSOFT'S HRDD IS INADEQUATEThe UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (\"UNGPs\")3 constitute the global authoritative framework outlining human rights responsibilities of states and businesses, and expectations are heightened for companies with business activities in conflict-affected and high- risk areas. Companies are expected to take all reasonable steps to ensure their products and services - including the deployment of such technologies by customers - are not used to violate human rights. To meet these obligations, companies should conduct HRDD to identify, prevent, miti-gate, and account for adverse human rights impacts, and to transparently report on the effectiveness of such HRDD. Microsoft states it conducts ongoing HRDD across its value chain, in line with its obligations under the UNGPs,4 but it provides insufficient information about the effectiveness of its HRDD processes related to customer end use.5Despite Microsoft's policies suggesting that the Company undertakes proactive and ongoing due diligence, potential misuse of its products has been uncovered not by internal HRDD but by investigative journalism. Foley Hoag's human rights impact assessment (\"HRIA\") highlighted that \"Microsoft describes its human rights management as \"hub-and-spoke,\" intended to empower and support front line personnel to identify and address legal and policy issues, including human rights issues. To that end, Microsoft's teams do not typically follow a formal set of processes and protocols to identify and assess potential human rights risks.\"6 Foley Hoag noted that \"[c]onsequently, Microsoft has few internal policies and procedures that could be used by personnel as guidance to establish a standardized process for the identification, assessment, and elevation of human rights risks.\"7Beyond failures of human rights due diligence, Microsoft's conduct also raises questions about compliance with its primary Codes of Conduct in the Microsoft Services Agreement. These codes prohibit illegal activity and any behavior that harms or threatens to harm others, particularly children. Continued contracts with state and non-state actors implicated in systematic human rights abuses and violations, including those contravening international humanitarian law, represent not only process failures in HRDD but also negligence in enforcing the company's basic user policies and standards.Further, the Company's actions may constitute Business and Human Rights standards norms breaches. Recently issued guidance by the Church of England and a consortium of institutional investors and human rights experts categorizes cases of \"Company Breaches of Norms\" as substantive failures involving direct or enabling complicity in human rights violations.8 According to their guidance, if Microsoft conducts ongoing business operations with nation states involved in numerous and continual human rights violations, this could constitute being categorized as a  \"Norms Breach Company\", designated at the highest level of harm in terms of severity and irreversibility, exposing the Company to heightened shareholder scrutiny and potential exclusion from investment portfolios.The cumulative effect, despite the Company's claims to the contrary, is a risk management approach that is reac-tive and that does not assure investors or the public that high-risk client relationships are adequately assessed and monitored. This approach increases reputational, regulatory, and operational risks.</p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 4 -->\n<div>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n<tr>\n          <td> </td>\n          <td></td>\n          <td> </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n</table>\n    </div>\n<!-- Field: /Page --><img src=\"image-004.jpg\">\n\n<p>4HIGH-RISK CLIENTS AND JURISDICTIONS Microsoft recognizes that the nature and specific location of a customer can amplify risks, independently of the product offered requiring elevated scrutiny. Its Responsible AI Framework, for example, imposes limited access restrictions on certain products such as facial recognition tools when sold to government agencies.9 The Company's Global Human Rights Statement reaffirms its commitment to the UNGPs and emphasizes heightened due diligence for certain countries and HRIAs at both a product and corporate level.10 However, given repeated allegations of human rights issues, implementation appears to be uneven, particularly with respect to products such as Azure cloud storage, whose potential of being deployed in a manner harmful to people is less obvious than that of other AI tools, such as facial recognition. 2023 HRIA RECOMMENDED AN ASSESSMENT OF MICROSOFT'S MILITARY CONTRACTSFoley Hoag was commissioned by Microsoft (in response to a shareholder resolution) to conduct an independent HRIA, focused on Microsoft's licensing of cloud services (including those incorporating AI) to U.S. law enforcement (including agencies involved in policing and prisons) and immigration enforcement agencies.11 While the 2023 HRIA found no direct evidence that Microsoft's products and services caused or contributed to human rights harms, Foley Hoag made 23 recommendations. They included that the Company should \"consider conducting theme-specific due diligence exercises or additional HRIAs focused on: [...]assessing the company's commercial relationships with military agencies and their impacts on BIPOC and other vulnerable communities...\"12There is no public disclosure  confirming that an HRIA  has been done for military clients. These gaps underscore that HRDD practices (especially for high-risk client categories such as military agencies) are not sufficiently visible to investors or stakeholders.</p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 5 -->\n<div>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n<tr>\n          <td> </td>\n          <td></td>\n          <td> </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n</table>\n    </div>\n<!-- Field: /Page --><img src=\"image-005.jpg\">\n\n<p>5A PATTERN OF CONTROVERSY AND QUESTIONS ABOUT DUE DILIGENCEDespite the Company's claims that it carries out ongoing and proactive due diligence, there is a pattern of allega-tions over many years of  involvement in facilitating civil and human rights abuses and human rights violations. This raises significant concerns for investors about the Company's oversight and HRDD processes.5CHINA: ENABLING MASS SURVEILLANCE IN XINJIANGIn September 2025 Associated Press13 reported that Microsoft provided cloud services to Landasoft, a Chinese surveillance company implicated in the repression of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. According to the report, Landasoft registered accounts on Microsoft Azure in 2018 seeking to expand cloud offerings to police clients. Microsoft con-firmed that Landasoft accessed Azure through a self-service portal, which was retired in 2021, and stated that any data related to Landasoft was deleted. While factually accurate, the self-service framing does not remove Microsoft's responsibility under its own human rights policies: China represents a high-risk environment where, according to Microsoft's own policies, \"heightened due diligence\" should be carried out. Allowing a company with ties to repressive policing to access cloud services without proactive assessment raises questions about Microsoft's HRDD.In another example, Microsoft provided AI and cloud computing services and mentorship to Chinese startups, through its incubator program.14 After graduating the program, some companies have subsequently partnered with the Xinjiang police where their surveillance tools and support have reportedly been used by the Chinese government in its brutal oppression of the Uyghur population.15SAUDI ARABIA: CONCERNS OVER FACILITATING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSAssessments from Freedom House and the U.S. State Department show that Saudi Arabia is a high-risk human rights environment.16 In 2023, Human Rights Watch called on Microsoft to suspend its investment in a new cloud data center region in Saudi Arabia until it can clearly demonstrate how it will mitigate the risk of facilitating serious human rights violations.17 The concern arises from the potential for Saudi authorities to obtain access to data stored in Microsoft's cloud data center, posing threats to human rights and privacy. In 2024 a shareholder resolution calling for a HRIA about the data center in Saudi Arabia and other countries with human rights concerns was filed by Ek? and received a third of the shareholder vote.18ISRAEL: FACILITATING MASS SURVEILLANCE OF CIVILIANS In 2019, Microsoft invested in AnyVision which faced scrutiny following media reports that its technology was used to surveil Palestinians who lived in the occupied West Bank.19 Microsoft hired a team from Covington &amp; Burling and former US AG Eric Holder to investigate the claims.5</p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 6 -->\n<div>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n<tr>\n          <td> </td>\n          <td></td>\n          <td> </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n</table>\n    </div>\n<!-- Field: /Page --><img src=\"image-006.jpg\">\n\n<p>6Microsoft decided to divest from AnyVision despite investigation finding that the AnyVision technology was not used in mass surveillance.In 2025 Microsoft faced allegations that its Azure cloud and AI tools were used by the Israeli Military to carry out mass surveillance and cause civilian harm - see below for further details. UNITED STATES: HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRACTSIn response to shareholder concerns, Microsoft commissioned a HRIA  conducted by the law firm Foley Hoag LLP. The assessment, published in June 2023, examined the impact of Microsoft's cloud and artificial intelligence technologies licensed to U.S. federal and state law enforcement and immigration enforcement agencies. The HRIA found that while Microsoft has robust human rights policies, there are areas where the company can improve, particularly regarding its consulting services provided to law enforcement agencies, and offered recommendations on improving HRDD. MASS SURVEILLANCE OF CIVILIANS BY ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE AGENCYMicrosoft's recent announcement that it found \"evidence that supports\" Israel's Unit 8200 used its technologies in violation of the terms of service highlight weaknesses in the Company's HRDD and internal and external reviews.In early 2025, The Guardian20 and the Associated Press21 reported that Israel's military relied on Microsoft technology during its Gaza offensive, raising concerns that Azure cloud and AI tools could have been used in operations potentially posing risks to civilians. In response, Microsoft commissioned an internal review and engaged an external firm to undertake additional fact-finding. In May 2025, Microsoft announced that the review concluded there was \"no evidence that Microsoft's Azure and AI technologies, or any of our other software, have been used to harm people or that IMOD has failed to comply with our terms of service or our AI Code of Conduct.\"22 However, the review's method-ology, scope, full final report, or even the name of the external law firm were not disclosed. The absence of key information including which staff were consulted and how much reliance was placed on staff assurances, what data was examined, and how civilian harm was defined and assessed, makes it difficult to evaluate the adequacy of the review. Further reporting from the Guardian and others also raises questions about the robustness of that review. In August 2025, a joint investigation by The Guardian,23 +972 Magazine,24 and Local Call25 alleged that Unit 8200, an Israeli military intelligence unit, had used Microsoft's Azure cloud to store roughly 200 million hours of Palestinian phone call recordings from Gaza and the West Bank. The data, described as stored in \"a customized and segregated area within Azure,\" including data centers in the Netherlands and Ireland,26 was reportedly used to inform military targeting decisions, including operations that posed risks to civilians. </p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 7 -->\n<div>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n<tr>\n          <td> </td>\n          <td></td>\n          <td> </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n</table>\n    </div>\n<!-- Field: /Page --><img src=\"image-007.jpg\">\n\n<p>7The investigation, based on internal Microsoft documents and interviews with 11 sources from the Company and Israeli military intelligence, alleged that some Microsoft engineers were aware the data included raw intelligence, while Israel-based staff, including Unit 8200 alumni, appeared to understand the military objectives. The fact that evidence existed internally but was unavailable to the first review casts serious doubt on the adequacy of that assessment.Following this reporting, Microsoft commissioned a second external review, to be led by Covington &amp; Burling LLP with independent consultancy assistance, to examine allegations of mass surveillance that could constitute a breach of its Terms of Service.27 Microsoft has not confirmed to date whether Covington &amp; Burling was also the external firm involved in the first review. Microsoft has a long-standing commercial relationship with Covington &amp; Burling LLP, and Microsoft's Vice Chair and President, Brad Smith, who oversees Microsoft's implementation of its human rights commitments,28 was once a partner at the law firm29 creating at least perception of a conflict of interest.Microsoft subsequently announced on September 25, 2025, that it would cancel the specific contract with the Israeli military while continuing to work with them as a client. While this demonstrates that credible risks of real-world harm existed and required Microsoft to take corrective action, it also confirms that the first review failed to identify them. After the cancellation, Brad Smith sent a note to staff emphasizing that the second review \"...had not accessed any customer data but its findings were based on a review of internal Microsoft documents, emails and messages between staff\"30 and credited the Guardian reporting for bringing to light \"information we could not access in light of our customer privacy commitments.\"31 However, the Guardian's reporting relied in part on internal Microsoft documents indicating that information needed to assess risk was available internally during the first review but was not examined. The second review appeared to focus narrowly on whether cloud storage was used for mass surveillance, and seems not to explicitly address allegations that the stored data was used in military operations potentially harmful to civilians.32 The August 2025 reporting by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call highlighted these risks and prompted the second review, yet Microsoft treats these allegations as distinct from those addressed by the first re-view. In reality, they are the same category of risks, demonstrating that the first review did not, at minimum, examine the internal documents later cited by the investigative reporting. Given that Microsoft has revised its assessment of violation of its terms of service, it is unclear why the allegations of civilian-harm are not also being revisited.The sequence of events highlights weaknesses in and unresolved questions about Microsoft's HRDD, oversight, review processes, and transparency when it comes to high-risk client relationships. The prudent course of action at this time is to formally assess the effectiveness of Microsoft's HRDD practices in preventing, identifying, and addressing customer misuse of Microsoft AI and cloud products or services that violate human rights or international humanitarian law.The Guardian, August 6, 2025+972 Magazine, August 6, 2025</p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 8 -->\n<div>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n<tr>\n          <td> </td>\n          <td></td>\n          <td> </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n</table>\n    </div>\n<!-- Field: /Page --><img src=\"image-008.jpg\">\n\n<p>8ADEQUACY OF EXISTING EXTERNAL INVESTIGATIONSMicrosoft's response to these allegations has followed a familiar pattern: commissioning external reviews that conclude with \"no evidence\" of misuse, but new allegations continue to arise. In 2020, Covington &amp; Burling LLP found no breach in relation to Microsoft's investment in the Israeli surveillance firm AnyVision although the Company subsequently divested. In 2023, the Foley Hoag HRIA reached similar no evidence of harm findings regarding Microsoft's services and products by US law enforcement agencies. The first review into Israeli military contracts in early 2025 repeated this formula, concluding that Azure and AI technologies had not been used to harm civilians or violate Microsoft's terms of services. This pattern suggests structural deficiencies in Microsoft's HRDD including insufficient mechanisms to assess real-world impacts of high-risk clients, and raise questions about the scope and adequacy of external reviews. They are typically narrow in scope, and sometimes constrained by client agreements or Terms of Service that can limit disclosure, as seen in the Foley Hoag HRIA. Their opacity is heightened when methodologies, terms of reference, or full reports  are withheld, making it impossible to assess rigor or scope, or where their conclusions amount to mere blanket statements (e.g., \"found no evidence\"), which provide little basis for stakeholders or investors to evaluate whether underlying risks have been materially reduced.Microsoft's deference to Terms of Service and customer privacy commitments to define what can be investigated reflects a choice that limits its own ability to assess potential human rights abuses using their products by high-risk clients.33 Even when investigative reporting identifies potential misuse, internal reviews may be constrained from fully examining the facts, creating structural gaps in HRDD.Investors should support an independent review of Microsoft's HRDD to ensure high-risk client use is properly assessed and potential human rights risks are effectively mitigated.</p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 9 -->\n<div>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n<tr>\n          <td> </td>\n          <td></td>\n          <td> </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n</table>\n    </div>\n<!-- Field: /Page --><img src=\"image-009.jpg\">\n\n<p>9MATERIAL RISKS FOR INVESTORSThe recurring nature of these allegations suggests systemic issues with Microsoft's HRDD practices especially when it comes to high-risk clients such as military agencies. Inadequate HRDD exposes Microsoft to material, legal, operational, and reputational risks.Microsoft's potential complicity in international crimes in Gaza has resulted in outspoken opposition from its own employees,34 a boycott and divestment campaign against the Company,35 severe reputational damage that may harm long-term shareholder value, and risks exposing the company to legal and regulatory penalties.? FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RISK: ? Enterprises, governments, and other large customers may avoid association with companies under hu-man-rights or surveillance controversy. Loss of business, or demands for contract renegotiation and higher indemnification, can directly reduce revenue and margins. The UN Human Rights Council has highlighted the business risks of corporate complicity in conflict-affected areas.36? Meeting the criteria of a \"Norms Breach Company\" of international human rights standards, can expose the Company to shareholder action, engagement escalation, or exclusion from investment portfolios, which in turn can increase the Company's cost of capital.37? LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK: If voice recordings obtained through mass surveillance of civilians are stored in any Microsoft Data Centers located in Ireland or the Netherlands, this will likely breach the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. If any of this data  involves calls between people in the EU and in the West Bank or Gaza, this is likely an additional breach of the rights of EU citizens. The collection of this data does not appear to fall within any of the six legal grounds that allow for collection defined under the regulation. It is likely that com-plaints will be lodged with the EU lead's data protection authority - Ireland's Data Protection Commission - calling on the agency to investigate.The Dutch government announced they would \"request further investigation\", and if there are serious indica-tions of criminal offences, then the public prosecutor's office could decide to initiate legal proceedings.38It is also possible that efforts will be made to hold the company and/or its executives responsible in the courts if there is evidence of complicity in human rights violations. Universal jurisdiction, the principle that certain grave crimes (e.g., genocide, crimes against humanity) can be prosecuted irrespective of where they were committed or the nationality of perpetrators or victims, is increasingly being tested in the context of corporate complicity in human rights violations. This presents heightened legal and reputational risk for companies and their investors. Substantiated allegations such as misuse of cloud services, GDPR violations, or human rights harms could also increase perceived risk, raising equity risk premiums and pushing up the cost of debt as lenders incorporate litigation and regulatory exposure into credit spreads.399</p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 10 -->\n<div>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n<tr>\n          <td> </td>\n          <td></td>\n          <td> </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n</table>\n    </div>\n<!-- Field: /Page --><img src=\"image-010.jpg\">\n\n<p>10? OPERATIONAL RISK: Involvement in controversial partnerships that attract the attention of the media, civil society, and regulators can distract senior management from Microsoft's core business objectives. Employee protests and activism over controversial contracts can depress morale, erode trust in management, increase quits, and slow delivery in mission-critical teams.42 At a time when tech companies are competing intensely for key employees to win the competitive race on AI, Microsoft can ill afford to undermine its ability to acquire and retain top talent. ? REPUTATIONAL RISK: In June 2025, United Nations Special Rapporteur, Francesca Albanese, presented a new report - \"From economy of occupation to economy of genocide\"- to the United Nations' Human Rights Coun-cil, which names companies she says are profiting from, and therefore complicit in, war crimes and genocide in Gaza.43 She includes Microsoft, noting its decades-long involvement in Israel and the extensive access Micro-soft grants the Israeli government to its AI technologies, data analytics, and surveillance.44 Microsoft is facing repeated allegations of its products being used to facilitate human rights violations, which is drawing internal45 and external criticism46 which is itself continuously generating headlines which damage the company's brand and can erode public and customer trust.  ? SYSTEMIC RISK: Microsoft is the second largest stock weights in the S&amp;P 500, at ~6.4%,47 with a market capital-ization of roughly USD 3.8 trillion.48 When a company of this size suffers a reputational or legal shock, the effects ripple through index-tracking portfolios and pension funds. Exposure to Microsoft is often unavoidable for in-vestors. For diversified investors and \"universal owners,\" these portfolio-level impacts of the Company's actions make it essential to monitor potential risks associated with Microsoft's operations and public perception. Addressing the costs of human rights violations may help protect shareholders from economy-wide risks, including those resulting from human rights abuses potentially associated with Microsoft's products. Market performance, and, accordingly, the long-term performance of diversified portfolios, depends on the health of the economy, which can be undermined when companies' activities create social and environmental costs that drag on GDP.49 Conflict and human rights violations can generate spillover effects that disrupt trade, investment, and financial markets beyond local economies.50 Reports indicate that Microsoft's technologies have been linked to LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALLEGED COMPLICITY IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMESLundin Case (Sweden)On 11 November 2021, the Swedish public prosecutor formally charged the chief executive of Lundin Energy (formerly Lundin Petroleum) and the chairman of the Board for aiding and abetting war crimes that occurred between 1999 and 2003 in Sudan, now South Sudan. Both deny the allegations. The trial started on 5 September 2023 and the concluding pleas will be delivered in February and March 2026.40Lafarge Case (France)French cement company Lafarge is facing charges of complicity in crimes against humanity, and financing terrorism and violating an embargo.41 Between 2013 and 2014, Lafarge allegedly made payments to terrorist groups, including ISIS, to continue operations at its Syrian cement plant amidst the civil war.10</p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 11 -->\n<div>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n<tr>\n          <td> </td>\n          <td></td>\n          <td> </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n</table>\n    </div>\n<!-- Field: /Page --><img src=\"image-011.jpg\">\n\n<p>11military targeting and surveillance activities in Gaza, contributing to the destruction of infrastructure, the displacement of communities, and loss of life, factors that depress economic productivity and slow recovery. These dynamics not only weaken local economies but can ripple globally, heightening legal, reputational, and systemic risks, and threatening the long-term returns of diversified investors.51Shareholders need to be assured that the Company's strategy is not mispricing and undervaluing the risks associat-ed with continuing business with customers  in violation of the Company's standards and policies. Continuing contracts that bear numerous and compounding material risks and costs to the Company should be weighed against the revenue gained by such contracts and the costs of adequate and efficient due diligence. Negligence to address these due diligence failures raises numerous issues related to the Company's Duty of Care to shareholders. Robust due diligence practices are essential to mitigate these risks. Given repeated allegations, an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's HRDD processes and practices is needed.  By taking proactive steps, Microsoft can safeguard its reputation, ensure compliance with international standards, and maintain investor confidence.CONCLUSIONMicrosoft acknowledges that client category and geographic location impact likelihood of product misuse and human rights impacts. Yet it has not demonstrably consistently translated this awareness into systematic, heightened HRDD. External assessments, such as the Foley Hoag HRIA, have explicitly recommended assessing the company's relationship with military agencies and working with stakeholders to discuss priorities for future HRDD but the company has not publicly committed to fully implementing these recommendations. A stream of accusa-tions and the Company's recent decision to cancel one of its contracts with the  Israeli military strongly suggest that Microsoft's current, largely reactive measures to allegations of human rights abuses by customers are inadequate. Without a comprehensive, systematic approach to due diligence, shareholders remain exposed to significant material, financial, legal &amp; regulatory, and reputational risks. Supporting the 2025 shareholder resolution is therefore prudent.</p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 12 -->\n<div>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n<tr>\n          <td> </td>\n          <td></td>\n          <td> </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n</table>\n    </div>\n<!-- Field: /Page --><img src=\"image-012.jpg\">\n\n<p>12DISCLAIMERNone of Ek?, Investor Advocates for Social Justice (IASJ), Center for Middle East Investment (CMEI), nor Racial Justice Investing (RJI) are investment or financial advisors, and do not make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in any particular company or investment fund or vehicle.

My name is Aaron Acosta, and on behalf of lead proponents Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary Charitable Trust and the Sisters\nof the Sacred Heart of Mary and <b>57 additional co-filers</b>, we respectfully request your support for our shareholder proposal at Microsoft\nCorporation (MSFT), which can be found </font><font>here</font><font>.\nWe would welcome the opportunity to meet to discuss the proposal in greater detail. </font></p>\n\n<p><font>The proposal\nasks Microsoft to publish a report, assessing the effectiveness of its human rights due diligence (“HRDD”) processes in preventing,\nidentifying, and addressing customer misuse of Microsoft artificial intelligence (“AI”) and cloud products or services that\nviolates human rights or international humanitarian law. You can find our exempt solicitation, which explains the material risks, </font><font>here</font><font>.</font></p>\n\n<p>We believe support for this\nshareholder resolution is warranted because Microsoft’s current HRDD appears insufficient in preventing, identifying, and addressing\ncustomer misuse of its technologies and services. This was highlighted most recently by the Company’s decision to terminate one\nof its contracts with the Israeli military, following a journalistic investigation that revealed its technologies had been employed in\nmass surveillance of Palestinians. Notably, it was the journalistic investigation, not Microsoft’s HRDD, that brought to light the\ncustomer misuse. Our exempt solicitation shows that this example of ineffective HRDD is just one of many cases in which the Company’s\ntechnologies and services have been used to violate human rights and international humanitarian law, underscoring the importance of the\nrequested report on the effectiveness of Microsoft’s HRDD.</p>\n\n<p>Ineffective HRDD exposes investors\nto material risks, including:</p>\n\n<table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>●</td>\n<td>\n<b>Financial Risk</b>: potential loss of revenue or increased cost of capital, potential portfolio impacts for investors due to S&amp;P\n500 weighting.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>\n\n<table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>●</td>\n<td>\n<b>Legal and Regulatory Risk</b>: potential financial liability for the Company under EU laws; potential criminal liability for the\nCompany and its executives for complicity in human rights violations.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>\n\n<table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>●</td>\n<td>\n<b>Operational Risk</b>: negative impacts on key talent recruitment and retention; distractions of senior management from core business.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>\n\n<table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>●</td>\n<td>\n<b>Reputational Risks</b>: Microsoft named by UN Special Rapporteur as profiting from, and therefore complicit in, war crimes and\ngenocide in Gaza.

Monroe St., 14th Floor, Chicago, IL 60661  \n---|---|---  \n**This Notice and the attached written materials are filed pursuant to Rule 14a-6(g)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.**\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n---  \nOctober 15, 2025\nDear fellow Tesla shareholders,\n**We encourage shareholders of Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla” or “the Company”) to _vote for Proposal Eleven_ on the Company’s 2025 Proxy Statement. **This proposal asks the Company to adopt a bylaw amendment requiring shareholder ratification within one year of Tesla’s implementation of a bylaw amendment adopting more restrictive requirements for submitting shareholder proposals, as newly permitted under Texas law (Section 21.373 of the Texas Business Organizations Code).\nTesla’s reincorporation in Texas grants the Company new authority to unilaterally impose the thresholds in Section 21.373 of the Texas Business Organizations Code, requiring shareholders or groups of shareholders to hold 3% of the corporation’s voting shares or voting shares of $1 million in market value to submit 14a-8 shareholder proposals. These thresholds exceed current SEC standards and could limit the voices of retail and institutional investors, undermining the Company’s governance structure.\nThe resolved clause of the proposal states:\n_RESOLVED, pursuant to Article X of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Tesla, Inc., shareholders of Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”) hereby amend the Bylaws to add the following to the end of Article X:_\n_“; and provided further, however, that any amendment of these bylaws by the board of directors to make the “affirmative election” referenced in section 21.373(b) of the TBOC to be governed by section 21.373 of the TBOC shall be invalid if it is not ratified within one year of such amendment by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of outstanding voting securities, voting together as a single class.”_\n**Why This Matters Now**\nTesla is navigating a period of volatility – from leadership transitions to ambitious technological pivots. In such times, robust shareholder rights are an essential means to take the pulse of investor concerns and priorities. Proposal Eleven ensures that future attempts to restrict shareholder input by amending the Company’s bylaws must be ratified by shareholders themselves.\nThis is a reasonable governance safeguard that would enhance Tesla’s commitment to shareholder engagement and accountability. **A vote for Proposal Eleven is a vote to protect shareholder rights.**\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n---  \n**Responding to the Company’s Opposition**\nIn Tesla’s opposition statement to Proposal Eleven, the Board makes several points that warrant further review. Specifically:\n| **1.** |  **Reconciling the Board’s stated commitment to shareholder feedback with its opposition to Proposal Eleven.** The Board emphasizes its commitment to shareholder engagement, stating that “[t]he Board has consistently demonstrated its commitment to shareholders’ ability to communicate with Tesla or with each other.” The Board further notes that investor feedback has helped inform the Board and contributed to the adoption of governance and disclosure practices. In the Letter to Shareholders at the top of the Proxy Statement, Board Chair Robyn Denholm and Director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson highlight Tesla’s reincorporation in Texas, writing: “We are in Texas because it provides a more predictable corporate governance framework that allows us to hear from you as the people who know Tesla best –  \n---|---|---  \nIf the Board actively seeks to hear from shareholders, it is difficult to reconcile this stated commitment with its opposition to Proposal Eleven. This proposal simply asks that a supermajority of shareholders be required to ratify the Board’s implementation of a bylaw amendment adopting Texas Business Organizations Code thresholds for shareholder proposals – thresholds that would directly impact shareholders’ ability to communicate with the Board and Company management. Notably, the Board offers no assurance it will refrain from adopting the more stringent submission thresholds.\n| **2.** |  **Responding to the supermajority argument.** The Board argues that Proposal Eleven could impose a new supermajority voting requirement, which they state could be detrimental to shareholders. This argument fails to appreciate the purpose of the proposal, which is to invalidate a bylaw adopting the more restrictive thresholds for filing shareholder proposals allowed under Texas law if not ratified by a supermajority of shareholders.  \n---|---|---  \nProposal Eleven provides an additional opportunity for shareholders to oppose such an amendment when such significant rights are at issue.\n| 3. |  **Responding to the Board’s flexibility argument.** The Board argues that the presence of multiple shareholder proposals addressing Section 21.373 of the Texas Business Organizations Code underscores the need for Board flexibility. Proposal Eleven does not constrain the Board’s ability to evaluate or consider governance options. The Board retains full discretion to assess and recommend governance decisions. Proposal Eleven does not interfere with that discretion – it simply ensures that if the Board chooses to restrict shareholders’ ability to submit proposals by amending its bylaws, it must seek shareholder ratification to maintain such a change. Ensuring shareholders have an additional protection in relation to a decision such as this that affects their rights is not only fair, but it would also build trust and confidence among shareholders as well as contribute to the development of a more transparent, responsive governance structure.  \n---|---|---  \n**We encourage our fellow investors to _vote for Proposal Eleven_ as a clear step toward protecting our rights as shareholders and ensuring that the Company acts in alignment with its investors.**\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n---  \n_IMPORTANT NOTICE: The cost of this communication is being borne entirely by the Office of the Illinois State Treasurer.

(“Tesla” or “the Company”)\nto <u>vote for Proposal Eleven</u> on the Company’s 2025 Proxy Statement. </b>This proposal asks the Company to adopt a bylaw amendment\nrequiring shareholder ratification within one year of Tesla’s implementation of a bylaw amendment adopting more restrictive requirements\nfor submitting shareholder proposals, as newly permitted under Texas law (Section 21.373 of the Texas Business Organizations Code).</p>\n\n<p>Tesla’s reincorporation in Texas grants the Company new authority to unilaterally\nimpose the thresholds in Section 21.373 of the Texas Business Organizations Code, requiring shareholders or groups of shareholders to\nhold 3% of the corporation’s voting shares or voting shares of $1 million in market value to submit 14a-8 shareholder proposals.\nThese thresholds exceed current SEC standards and could limit the voices of retail and institutional investors, undermining the Company’s\ngovernance structure.</p>\n\n<p>The resolved clause of the proposal states:</p>\n\n<p><i>RESOLVED, pursuant to Article X of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Tesla,\nInc., shareholders of Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”) hereby amend the Bylaws to add the following to the end of Article X:</i></p>\n\n<p><i>“; and provided further, however, that any amendment of these\nbylaws by the board of directors to make the “affirmative election” referenced in section 21.373(b) of the TBOC to be governed\nby section 21.373 of the TBOC shall be invalid if it is not ratified within one year of such amendment by the affirmative vote of the\nholders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of outstanding voting securities, voting together as a single class.”</i></p>\n\n<p><font><b>Why This Matters Now</b></font></p>\n\n<p>Tesla is navigating a period of volatility – from leadership transitions to\nambitious technological pivots. In such times, robust shareholder rights are an essential means to take the pulse of investor concerns\nand priorities. Proposal Eleven ensures that future attempts to restrict shareholder input by amending the Company’s bylaws must\nbe ratified by shareholders themselves.</p>\n\n<p>This is a reasonable governance safeguard that would enhance Tesla’s commitment\nto shareholder engagement and accountability. <b>A vote for Proposal Eleven is a vote to protect shareholder rights.</b></p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 2 -->\n    <div><table><tbody><tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td></td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr></tbody></table></div>\n    <div><table><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n    <!-- Field: /Page -->\n\n<p><font><b>Responding to the Company’s Opposition</b></font></p>\n\n<p>In Tesla’s opposition statement to Proposal Eleven, the Board makes several\npoints that warrant further review. Specifically:</p>\n\n<table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><b>1.</b></td>\n<td>\n<b>Reconciling the Board’s stated commitment to shareholder feedback with its opposition to Proposal Eleven. </b>The Board emphasizes\nits commitment to shareholder engagement, stating that “[t]he Board has consistently demonstrated its commitment to shareholders’\nability to communicate with Tesla or with each other.” The Board further notes that investor feedback has helped inform the Board\nand contributed to the adoption of governance and disclosure practices. In the Letter to Shareholders at the top of the Proxy Statement,\nBoard Chair Robyn Denholm and Director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson highlight Tesla’s reincorporation in Texas, writing: “We are\nin Texas because it provides a more predictable corporate governance framework that allows us to hear from you as the people who know\nTesla best –</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>If the Board actively seeks to hear from shareholders, it is difficult\nto reconcile this stated commitment with its opposition to Proposal Eleven. This proposal simply asks that a supermajority of shareholders\nbe required to ratify the Board’s implementation of a bylaw amendment adopting Texas Business Organizations Code thresholds for\nshareholder proposals – thresholds that would directly impact shareholders’ ability to communicate with the Board and Company\nmanagement. Notably, the Board offers no assurance it will refrain from adopting the more stringent submission thresholds.</p>\n\n<table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><b>2.</b></td>\n<td>\n<b>Responding to the supermajority argument. </b>The Board argues that Proposal Eleven could impose a new supermajority voting requirement,\nwhich they state could be detrimental to shareholders. This argument fails to appreciate the purpose of the proposal, which is to invalidate\na bylaw adopting the more restrictive thresholds for filing shareholder proposals allowed under Texas law if not ratified by a supermajority\nof shareholders.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>Proposal Eleven provides an additional opportunity for shareholders to\noppose such an amendment when such significant rights are at issue.</p>\n\n<table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>3.</td>\n<td>\n<b>Responding to the Board’s flexibility argument. </b>The Board argues that the presence of multiple shareholder proposals\naddressing Section 21.373 of the Texas Business Organizations Code underscores the need for Board flexibility. Proposal Eleven does not\nconstrain the Board’s ability to evaluate or consider governance options. The Board retains full discretion to assess and recommend\ngovernance decisions. Proposal Eleven does not interfere with that discretion – it simply ensures that if the Board chooses to restrict\nshareholders’ ability to submit proposals by amending its bylaws, it must seek shareholder ratification to maintain such a change.\nEnsuring shareholders have an additional protection in relation to a decision such as this that affects their rights is not only fair,\nbut it would also build trust and confidence among shareholders as well as contribute to the development of a more transparent, responsive\ngovernance structure.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p><b>We encourage our fellow investors to <u>vote for Proposal Eleven</u> as a clear\nstep toward protecting our rights as shareholders and ensuring that the Company acts in alignment with its investors.</b></p>\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 3 -->\n    <div><table><tbody><tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td></td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr></tbody></table></div>\n    <div><table><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n    <!-- Field: /Page -->\n\n<p><i>IMPORTANT NOTICE: The cost of this communication is being borne entirely by the\nOffice of the Illinois State Treasurer.

Sure — others take different approaches to governance, and we’re not here to challenge what they’ve done or tell them how to run their companies.

Our directors prioritize providing oversight to ensure the company and shareholders’ interests are protected and have the technical expertise necessary to identify and deliberate on Tesla’s key strategic issues in pursuit of these interests. They also have the right personal skills and disposition to challenge, disagree with, and drive the management team and each other to find the best solutions as they exercise independent judgment in doing right by shareholders. These directors, alongside our full Board, have overseen Tesla’s transformation from an upstart electric vehicle manufacturer to a provider of autonomous solutions that are changing the world, while delivering jaw-dropping shareholder value creation along the way. We need their insights and guidance for our next chapter. VoteTesla.com Ira Ehrenpreis Ira has tirelessly served as a fortifying mentor, steering Tesla through exceptional growth and leading the implementation of a successful governance framework, while exemplifying active, hands-on engagement with the business and leadership team. His deep technical knowledge enables in-depth debate and problem-solving on the key strategic issues for Tesla’s products and strategies. Joe Gebbia Joe is a visionary tech founder himself, leading Airbnb — one of the most successful tech companies — from startup to public company, making it a household name with worldwide operations. We will continue to benefit greatly from his entrepreneurial background and design expertise moving forward. Kathleen Wilson-Thompson Kathleen brings decades of legal and operational experience to our Board. Her service on the 2024 and 2025 special committees makes her a vital voice as we navigate Tesla’s next chapter.

Our Board has an ongoing active and direct dialogue with shareholders, which helps inform the Board’s continuous evaluation of our corporate governance structure, practices, and policies. The Board also recognizes the unique attributes of Tesla and its leadership team and knows that driving meteoric growth can be achieved, but not by following the playbooks of other companies. We’ve painstakingly designed a governance model tailored to create and protect extraordinary shareholder value and support Tesla’s mission. For example, our Board prioritizes long-term shareholder returns — the cornerstone of good governance — by ensuring management incentives are strictly tied to the creation of extraordinary shareholder value. In an era when mediocre performance or short-term thinking is rewarded at the expense of long-term strategy, Tesla’s approach stands out for its creativity, rigor, and emphasis on accountability.

Most critics are missing the point**\n_Dr. Shane Goodwin is Executive Director of the SMU Corporate Governance Initiative, a collaborative effort between the Cox School of Business and Dedman School of Law at Southern Methodist University._\nFortune\nBy Dr. Shane Goodwin\n14 October 2025\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465925099333/tm252289d35_defa14aimg19.jpg)\n_Dr. Shane Goodwin served as a Governance Advisor to the Tesla Board’s Special Committee on the development of Elon Musk’s incentive compensation proposals. The viewpoints expressed below reflect those of Dr. Goodwin and not necessarily those of the Tesla Board or its Special Committee._\nThere has been no shortage of headlines and _clickbait opinions [fortune.com]_ from so-called “experts” about Tesla’s proposed compensation package for its once-in-a-generation CEO Elon Musk, yet most of them have thus far missed the point.\nIt’s easy to pass judgment from the metaphorical corporate governance ivory tower, but I was in the room as a governance advisor to the Tesla Board’s Special Committee and have a direct understanding of the thoughtful strategy behind this performance award. This plan was developed through a best-in-class corporate governance process. How do I know that? I have over 30 years of experience in corporate governance, M&A, and board leadership as an advisor, practitioner, educator, and expert witness — I’ve seen these processes play out countless times and know what effective and thoughtful board oversight looks like. Let me tell you why this is the right plan for Tesla and its shareholders. \nThis plan wouldn’t pay Elon based on promises — it is 100% contingent on a framework that requires achievement of market capitalization and operational milestones in support of his vision and ties his incentives directly to meeting those milestones. When you consider the details of the plan, it’s clear that creating extraordinary value for shareholders is the absolute priority. \nWhile this compensation plan may be atypical and not what shareholders and governance experts are used to, it is a true corporate governance masterclass by the Tesla Board’s Special Committee. This is a real-world governance approach focused entirely on how to maximize long-term results for shareholders, the owners of Tesla. In an era when executive compensation philosophy is often criticized for rewarding mediocre performance or short-term thinking at the expense of long-term strategy, Tesla’s approach stands out for its rigor and emphasis on accountability. Elon wins ONLY if Tesla shareholders win, and win big. \n**Why now — retaining a visionary when it matters most**\nAs Tesla’s focus shifts towards AI, robotics and sustainable energy products, the company is at an inflection point. The Board’s view is clear: Elon has a singular vision to lead Tesla forward, and retaining and motivating him is critical for the company’s future success. The Board recognized that standing still amidst Tesla’s evolution would be reckless and thus acted in the company’s best interest by taking swift action to secure Elon’s leadership when it mattered most.\nThe business risk of losing the leader who continues to drive Tesla’s innovation and attract the talent required to stand out in a crowded landscape is clear. The competition for top engineering and AI talent is getting hotter by the minute, and much of Tesla’s appeal as an employer and innovator is directly tied to Elon. The Board’s view is that Elon’s one-of-a-kind leadership is key not only to Tesla’s next phase of growth, but also to securing deep layers of impressive talent that are necessary to accomplish Tesla’s goals. The cost of losing that leadership would be far higher than the cost of a well-structured, performance-only award that is 100% aligned with shareholders.\n**Gold standard special committee process**\nTake it from a professor and former investment banker — the creation of this plan was not an academic exercise in corporate governance. A disinterested Special Committee conducted a seven-month process, retained its own legal, compensation, valuation, accounting, and governance advisors, negotiated directly with Elon and deliberated extensively among themselves with the full Tesla Board (excluding Elon and Kimbal Musk). The full report has been publicly filed to permit shareholders to scrutinize the process and the conclusions. The Board could not have been more transparent.\n**No results, no reward**\nWhile headlines are focusing on the numbers, this plan focuses on real results for Tesla and its shareholders — sustained market capitalization milestones, staggering adjusted EBITDA hurdles, real-world product deployment and Elon remaining in a leadership role at the company and developing the next generation of leaders — for Elon to get paid and receive any additional voting influence over Tesla’s strategic direction. This means his incentives are not just tied to hitting highly ambitious targets, but also to ensuring those results are sustained over the long haul. At the same time, the plan prudently addresses retention of Tesla’s visionary leader through vesting periods of up to 10 years after the grant date. \nVoting power is the primary motivating factor for Elon. He has _spoken publicly [x.com]_ about a desire for greater influence over the direction of Tesla’s AI deployment. This plan provides an opportunity for enhanced ownership, but not so much that Elon can’t still be overturned by his fellow shareholders. \nThe operational and financial milestones create clear alignment between shareholder value creation and Elon’s compensation. If Elon doesn’t deliver results, he gets nothing. If he falls short of a market capitalization milestone, there is no consolation prize. Essentially, the Special Committee and the Board have developed a construct in which Elon does not receive the full compensation or get to keep the associated voting rights under the award until he successfully oversees the creation of what could be the most valuable company in the world — and remains in a leadership role for the applicable vesting period.\n**Shareholders’ high-stakes decision**\nResponsible, shareholder-first governance ties leadership’s upside to sustained shareholder value, through a transparent and disinterested process. That’s exactly what Tesla has delivered.\nNow, it’s up to shareholders to have the final say.\n_The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune._\n",

The viewpoints\nexpressed below reflect those of Dr. Goodwin and not necessarily those of the Tesla Board or its Special Committee.</i></p>\n\n<p>There has been no shortage of headlines and <u>clickbait\nopinions [fortune.com]</u> from so-called “experts” about Tesla’s proposed compensation package for its once-in-a-generation\nCEO Elon Musk, yet most of them have thus far missed the point.</p>\n\n<p>It’s easy to pass judgment from the metaphorical\ncorporate governance ivory tower, but I was in the room as a governance advisor to the Tesla Board’s Special Committee and have\na direct understanding of the thoughtful strategy behind this performance award. This plan was developed through a best-in-class corporate\ngovernance process. How do I know that? I have over 30 years of experience in corporate governance, M&amp;A, and board leadership as an\nadvisor, practitioner, educator, and expert witness — I’ve seen these processes play out countless times and know what\neffective and thoughtful board oversight looks like. Let me tell you why this is the right plan for Tesla and its shareholders. </p>\n\n<p>This plan wouldn’t pay Elon based on promises\n — it is 100% contingent on a framework that requires achievement of market capitalization and operational milestones in support\nof his vision and ties his incentives directly to meeting those milestones. When you consider the details of the plan, it’s clear\nthat creating extraordinary value for shareholders is the absolute priority.  </p>\n\n<p>While this compensation plan may be atypical and\nnot what shareholders and governance experts are used to, it is a true corporate governance masterclass by the Tesla Board’s Special\nCommittee. This is a real-world governance approach focused entirely on how to maximize long-term results for shareholders, the owners\nof Tesla. In an era when executive compensation philosophy is often criticized for rewarding mediocre performance or short-term thinking\nat the expense of long-term strategy, Tesla’s approach stands out for its rigor and emphasis on accountability. Elon wins ONLY if\nTesla shareholders win, and win big. </p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 24 -->\n    <!-- Field: /Page -->\n\n<p><b>Why now — retaining a visionary when\nit matters most </b></p>\n\n<p>As Tesla’s focus shifts towards AI, robotics\nand sustainable energy products, the company is at an inflection point. The Board’s view is clear: Elon has a singular vision to\nlead Tesla forward, and retaining and motivating him is critical for the company’s future success. The Board recognized that standing\nstill amidst Tesla’s evolution would be reckless and thus acted in the company’s best interest by taking swift action to secure\nElon’s leadership when it mattered most.</p>\n\n<p>The business risk of losing the leader who continues\nto drive Tesla’s innovation and attract the talent required to stand out in a crowded landscape is clear. The competition for top\nengineering and AI talent is getting hotter by the minute, and much of Tesla’s appeal as an employer and innovator is directly tied\nto Elon. The Board’s view is that Elon’s one-of-a-kind leadership is key not only to Tesla’s next phase of growth, but\nalso to securing deep layers of impressive talent that are necessary to accomplish Tesla’s goals. The cost of losing that leadership\nwould be far higher than the cost of a well-structured, performance-only award that is 100% aligned with shareholders.</p>\n\n<p><b>Gold standard special committee process</b></p>\n\n<p>Take it from a professor and former investment\nbanker — the creation of this plan was not an academic exercise in corporate governance. A disinterested Special Committee conducted\na seven-month process, retained its own legal, compensation, valuation, accounting, and governance advisors, negotiated directly with\nElon and deliberated extensively among themselves with the full Tesla Board (excluding Elon and Kimbal Musk). The full report has been\npublicly filed to permit shareholders to scrutinize the process and the conclusions. The Board could not have been more transparent.</p>\n\n<p><b>No results, no reward</b></p>\n\n<p>While headlines are focusing on the numbers, this\nplan focuses on real results for Tesla and its shareholders — sustained market capitalization milestones, staggering adjusted EBITDA\nhurdles, real-world product deployment and Elon remaining in a leadership role at the company and developing the next generation of leaders\n — for Elon to get paid and receive any additional voting influence over Tesla’s strategic direction. This means his incentives\nare not just tied to hitting highly ambitious targets, but also to ensuring those results are sustained over the long haul. At the same\ntime, the plan prudently addresses retention of Tesla’s visionary leader through vesting periods of up to 10 years after the grant\ndate. </p>\n\n<p>Voting power is the primary motivating factor\nfor Elon. He has <u>spoken publicly [x.com]</u> about a desire for greater influence over the direction of Tesla’s AI deployment.\nThis plan provides an opportunity for enhanced ownership, but not so much that Elon can’t still be overturned by his fellow shareholders.  </p>\n\n<p>The operational and financial milestones create\nclear alignment between shareholder value creation and Elon’s compensation. If Elon doesn’t deliver results, he gets nothing.\nIf he falls short of a market capitalization milestone, there is no consolation prize. Essentially, the Special Committee and the Board\nhave developed a construct in which Elon does not receive the full compensation or get to keep the associated voting rights under the\naward until he successfully oversees the creation of what could be the most valuable company in the world — and remains in a leadership\nrole for the applicable vesting period.</p>\n\n<p><b>Shareholders’ high-stakes decision</b></p>\n\n<p>Responsible, shareholder-first governance ties\nleadership’s upside to sustained shareholder value, through a transparent and disinterested process. That’s exactly what Tesla\nhas delivered.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it’s up to shareholders to have the\nfinal say.</p>\n\n<p><i>The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary\npieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.</i></p>\n\n<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 25; Options: Last -->\n    <!-- Field: /Page -->\n\n</text>\n</description></filename></sequence></type></document>\n</body></html>",
